    <title>A Leave of Presence</title>

Forty-six years ago on April 3, 1967, I became the film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times. Some of you have read my reviews and columns and even written to me since that time. Others were introduced to my film criticism through the television show, my books, the website, the film festival, or the Ebert Club and newsletter. &nbsp;However you came to know me, I'm glad you did and thank you for being the best readers any film critic could ask for.</p>

<p>Typically, I write over 200 reviews a year for the Sun-Times that are carried by Universal Press Syndicate in some 200 newspapers. Last year, I wrote the most of my career, including 306 movie reviews, a blog post or two a week, and assorted other articles. I must slow down now, which is why I'm taking what I like to call "a leave of presence."</p>

<p>What in the world is a leave of presence? It means I am not going away.  My intent is to continue to write selected reviews but to leave the rest to a talented team of writers handpicked and greatly admired by me. What's more, I'll be able at last to do what I've always fantasized about doing: reviewing only the movies I want to review.</p>

<p>At the same time, I am re-launching the new and improved Rogerebert.com and taking ownership of the site under a separate entity, <a href="http://www.ebertdigital.com/">Ebert Digital</a>, run by me, my beloved wife, Chaz, and our brilliant friend, Josh Golden of <a href="http://www.tablexi.com/">Table XI</a>. Stepping away from the day-to-day grind will enable me to continue as a film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, and roll out other projects under the Ebert brand in the coming year.</p>

<p><img alt="Ebertfest_Chaz_Roger.jpg" src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/a-leave-of-presence/Ebertfest_Chaz_Roger.jpg" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0px auto 20px;"></p>

<p>Ebertfest, my annual film festival, celebrating its 15th year, will continue at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, my alma mater and home town, April 17-21. In response to your repeated requests to bring back the TV show "At the Movies," I am launching a fundraising campaign via Kickstarter in the next couple of weeks. And gamers beware, I am even thinking about a movie version of a video game or mobile app. Once completed, you can engage me in debate on whether you think it is art.</p>

<p>And I continue to cooperate with the talented filmmaker <a href="/cast-and-crew/steve-james">Steve James</a> on the bio-documentary he, <a href="/cast-and-crew/steve-zaillian">Steve Zaillian</a> and <a href="/cast-and-crew/martin-scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> are making about my life. I am humbled that anyone would even think to do it, but I am also grateful.</p>

<p>Of course, there will be some changes. The immediate reason for my "leave of presence" is my health. The "painful fracture" that made it difficult for me to walk has recently been revealed to be a cancer. It is being treated with radiation, which has made it impossible for me to attend as many movies as I used to. I have been watching more of them on screener copies that the studios have been kind enough to send to me. My friend and colleague Richard Roeper and other critics have stepped up and kept the newspaper and website current with reviews of all the major releases. So we have and will continue to go on. At this point in my life, in addition to writing about movies, I may write about what it's like to cope with health challenges and the limitations they can force upon you. It really stinks that the cancer has returned and that I have spent too many days in the hospital. So on bad days I may write about the vulnerability that accompanies illness. On good days, I may wax ecstatic about a movie so good it transports me beyond illness.</p>

<p>I'll also be able to review classics for my "Great Movies" collection, which has produced three books and could justify a fourth.</p>

<p>For now, I am throwing myself into Ebert Digital and the redesigned, highly interactive and searchable Rogerebert.com. You'll learn more about its exciting new features on April 9 when the site is launched.  In addition to housing an archive of more than 10,000 of my reviews dating back to 1967 we will also feature reviews written by other critics. You may disagree with them like you have with me, but will nonetheless appreciate what they bring to the party. Some I recruited from the ranks of my Far Flung Correspondents, an inspiration I had four years ago when I noticed how many of the comments on my blog came from foreign lands and how knowledgeable they were about cinema.</p>

<p>We'll be recruiting more critics and it is my hope that some of the writers I have admired over the years will be among them. We'll offer many more reviews of Indie, foreign, documentary and restored classic revivals. As the space between broadcast television, cable and the internet morph into a hybrid of content, we will continue to spotlight the musings of Pulitzer Prize-winning TV critic Tom Shales, as well as the blog "<a href="/reviews/scanners-1981">Scanners</a>" by Jim Emerson, who I first met at Microsoft when he edited Cinemania. The Ebert Club newsletter, under editor Marie Haws of Vancouver, will be expanded to give its thousands of subscribers even bigger and better benefits.</p>

<p><img alt="Roger_old_office425pix.jpg" src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/a-leave-of-presence/Roger_old_office425pix.jpg" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="323" width="425"></p>

<p>For years I devoutly took every one of my tear sheets, folded them and added them to a pile on my desk. The photo above shows the height of that pile in 1985 as it appeared on the cover of my first book about the movies published by my old friends John McMeel and Donna Martin of Andrews &amp; McMeel. Today, because of technology, the opportunities to become bigger, better and reach more people are piling up too. The fact that we're re-launching the site now, in the midst of other challenges, should give you an idea how important Rogerebert.com and Ebert Digital are to Chaz and me. I hope you'll stop by, and look for me. I'll be there.</p>

<p>So on this day of reflection I say again, thank you for going on this journey with me. I'll see you at the movies.</p>

<p>PRESS RELEASE:  CHAMPAIGN, Ill. -- Terrence Malick's 1978 film "<a href="/reviews/great-movie-days-of-heaven-1978">Days of Heaven</a>" won an Oscar for best cinematography, and Roger Ebert likely found that no surprise. It is "above all one of the most beautiful films ever made," Ebert said in a 1997 review. So it's only appropriate that the film will open the 15th annual Roger Ebert's Film Festival on April 17 in the big-screen, newly renovated Virginia Theater in downtown Champaign.</p><p>Also among the 12 features and two shorts to be screened during the five-day "Ebertfest" -- running through April 21 at the Virginia and at the University of Illinois -- will be a kabuki-inspired drama from Japan; a recent silent film from Spain that deserved as much attention as "<a href="/reviews/the-artist-2011">The Artist</a>," according to Ebert; a sympathetic take on the "mad" painter Vincent Van Gogh, directed by frequent festival guest <a href="/cast-and-crew/paul-cox">Paul Cox</a>; and a documentary, which will close the festival, about veterans overcoming their wounds through fly-fishing on a Montana ranch.</p>

<p>Oscar-winner <a href="/cast-and-crew/tilda-swinton">Tilda Swinton</a> was a guest for the 2011 Ebertfest and returns this year with the crime thriller "Julia," in which she plays the title role of an unlikable "tough broad who is in way over her head," according to Ebert. <a href="/cast-and-crew/jack-black">Jack Black</a> will be a guest with a very different crime story, "<a href="/reviews/bernie-2012">Bernie</a>," in which he plays the title role of a funeral director who everyone likes but who has something to hide.</p>

<p>Other festival guests will include most of the films' directors, along with others connected with the films -- among them a U. of I. alumnus.</p>

<p>As usual, all the festival films will be screened at the 1,500-seat Virginia Theater, a 1920s-era movie palace, with other events (to be announced later) at the U. of I.</p>

<p>Since last year's festival, extensive work at the theater has brought in all new seating, extensive plaster repair and painting, installation of an elevator and other accessibility features, along with other improvements.</p>

<p>This year's schedule of films, with the current lineup of guests (Ebert's comments are from past reviews or his online journal):</p>

<p><b>Wednesday, April 17</b></p>

<p><img alt="Days-of-Heaven.jpg" src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/days-of-ebertfest-the-2013-schedule/Days-of-Heaven.jpg" width="425" height="246" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p>

<p><b>7 p.m. -- "Days of Heaven" (1978)</b>, a drama that takes place in the years before World War I on the Texas prairie, in which a farmhand convinces the woman he loves to marry a rich farmer who appears to be dying. Told from the perspective of the farmhand's teenage kid sister, it features <a href="/cast-and-crew/brooke-adams">Brooke Adams</a>, <a href="/cast-and-crew/richard-gere">Richard Gere</a> and <a href="/cast-and-crew/sam-shepard">Sam Shepard</a>. <a href="/cast-and-crew/haskell-wexler">Haskell Wexler</a>, an uncredited director of photography for the film, will be a guest. Credited Director of Photography Néstor Almendros won an Oscar for the film.</p>

<p>Before the film will be the short "I Remember" (2012), with director Grace Wang as a guest.</p>

<p><b>Thursday, April 18</b></p>

<p><img alt="vincent-the-life-and-death-of-vincent-van-gogh.jpg" src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/days-of-ebertfest-the-2013-schedule/vincent-the-life-and-death-of-vincent-van-gogh.jpg" width="425" height="239" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p>

<p><b>1 p.m. -- "Vincent: The Life and Death of Vincent Van Gogh" (1987)</b>, a film that takes the viewer inside the life and work of Van Gogh, based on hundreds of letters the painter wrote to his brother. The director Paul Cox "adopts the role of a disciple of the painter," says Ebert, exploring Van Gogh's technique even down to the brushstroke at times, and portraying the painter as a "poetic, thoughtful man ... open to the full range of his experience." Cox will be a guest.</p>

<p>Before the film will be the short "To Music" (2013), with co-directors Sophie Kohn and Feike Santbergen and actor Paul Cox as guests.</p>

<p><img alt="inthefamily.jpg" src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/days-of-ebertfest-the-2013-schedule/inthefamily.jpg" width="425" height="255" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p>

<p><b>4 p.m. -- "<a href="/reviews/in-the-family-2012">In the Family</a>" (2012)</b>, a drama essentially about a father and son being separated against their wishes, according to Ebert, though the story is more complicated than that. The film "tells a quiet, firm, deeply humanist story about doing the right thing." First-time director <a href="/cast-and-crew/patrick-wang">Patrick Wang</a>, who also wrote the screenplay and gives an "extraordinary performance" as the father, will be a guest.</p>

<p><img alt="bernie-2011.jpg" src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/days-of-ebertfest-the-2013-schedule/bernie-2011.jpg" width="425" height="255" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p>

<p><b>9 p.m. -- "Bernie" (2011)</b>, a droll comedy based on a true story in Carthage, Texas, in which a much-liked funeral director befriends a much-older and much-disliked rich widow, before things turn sour. Jack Black plays the title role, giving "one of the performances of the year," says Ebert, with <a href="/cast-and-crew/shirley-maclaine">Shirley MacLaine</a> as the widow. Black and director <a href="/cast-and-crew/richard-linklater">Richard Linklater</a> will be guests.</p>

<p><b>Friday, April 19</b></p>

<p><img alt="Oslo-August-31-.jpg" src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/days-of-ebertfest-the-2013-schedule/Oslo-August-31-.jpg" width="425" height="257" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p>

<p><b>1 p.m. -- "Oslo, August 31st" (2011)</b>, a Norwegian film about a day in the life of a drug addict struggling to stay clean and sober, and feeling that life has moved on without him. It is "quietly, profoundly, one of the most observant and sympathetic films I've seen," Ebert says. Director <a href="/cast-and-crew/joachim-trier">Joachim Trier</a> will be a guest.</p>

<p><img alt="the_ballad_of_narayama.jpg" src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/days-of-ebertfest-the-2013-schedule/the_ballad_of_narayama.jpg" width="425" height="209" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p>

<p><b>4 p.m. -- "<a href="/reviews/the-ballad-of-narayama-1983">The Ballad of Narayama</a>" (1958)</b>, a Japanese film "of great beauty and elegant artifice, telling a story of startling cruelty," Ebert says. That cruelty involves a village and its tradition of carrying those who have reached the age of 70 up a mountain and leaving them there to die. Presented in the style of kabuki theater, and structured around song and dance, it centers on the relationship between an elderly mother and her son. Film historian David Bordwell will be a guest.</p>

<p><img alt="Julia_tilda.jpg" src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/days-of-ebertfest-the-2013-schedule/Julia_tilda.jpg" width="425" height="275" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p>

<p><b>8:30 p.m. -- "Julia" (2008)</b>, "one doozy of a great thriller," Ebert says, in which Tilda Swinton is "amazing." She plays an unlikable woman in search of a big score, on a "nightmare journey through a thicket of people you do not want to meet," at the same time protecting a young boy. Swinton will be a guest.</p>

<p><b>Saturday, April 20</b></p>

<p><img alt="blancanieves.jpg" src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/days-of-ebertfest-the-2013-schedule/blancanieves.jpg" width="425" height="283" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p>

<p><b>11 a.m. -- "<a href="/reviews/blancanieves-2012">Blancanieves</a>" (2012)</b>, "a visually stunning" silent film from Spain, accompanied by a "full-throated romantic score," whose story draws on the Brothers Grimm and Snow White and yet "is anything but a children's film," Ebert says. The plot revolves around the daughter of a famous matador who eventually becomes a matador herself. Director <a href="/cast-and-crew/pablo-berger">Pablo Berger</a> will be a guest.</p>

<p><img alt="Kumare.jpg" src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/days-of-ebertfest-the-2013-schedule/Kumare.jpg" width="425" height="220" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p>

<p><b>2 p.m. -- "<a href="/reviews/kumare-2012">Kumare</a>" (2011)</b>, a documentary that follows filmmaker <a href="/cast-and-crew/vikram-gandhi">Vikram Gandhi</a>, raised in New Jersey in a Hindu family, as he sets himself up as a guru in Arizona and begins to attract followers. The film is not satirical or snarky, as one might expert, Ebert says, and "seems to establish that a guru can be a complete fraud and nevertheless do a certain amount of good." Gandhi and executive producer Stephen Feder, a U. of I. media studies graduate, will be guests.</p>

<p><img alt="escape-from-tomorrow.jpg" src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/days-of-ebertfest-the-2013-schedule/escape-from-tomorrow.jpg" width="425" height="239" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p>

<p><b>5 p.m. -- "Escape From Tomorrow" (2013)</b>, a fantasy/drama and "fun paranoia ride ... about the terror of ubiquitous entertainment," says reviewer Michał Oleszczyk. Shot guerrilla-style almost entirely at Disney World, the film revolves around a father who becomes obsessed with a couple of sexy French tourists and then "gets caught up in the dark underside of the surrounding kingdom." The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January. Director Randy Moore and producer/editor Soogin Chung will be guests.</p>

<p><img alt="The-Spectacular-Now.jpg" src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/days-of-ebertfest-the-2013-schedule/The-Spectacular-Now.jpg" width="425" height="264" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p>

<p><b>9 p.m. -- "The Spectacular Now" (2013)</b>, a comedy/drama about a high school boy and girl and their developing relationship, which also premiered at the recent Sundance. Its characters "look, speak and feel like real 18-year-old middle-American human beings," which is rare for a film about high-school romance, Ebert says. Director <a href="/cast-and-crew/james-ponsoldt">James Ponsoldt</a> will be a guest.</p>

<p><b>Sunday, April 21</b></p>

<p><img alt="Not Yet Begun to Fight.jpg" src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/days-of-ebertfest-the-2013-schedule/Not_20Yet_20Begun_20to_20Fight.jpg" width="425" height="239" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p>

<p><b>Noon -- "<a href="/reviews/not-yet-begun-to-fight-2012">Not Yet Begun to Fight</a>" (2012)</b>, a documentary about men of broken body and soul and their therapy through fly-fishing on a Montana ranch. The men are wounded veterans participating in a group called "Warriors and Quiet Waters." Guests will include the producer/co-director <a href="/cast-and-crew/sabrina-lee">Sabrina Lee</a>, the co-director and editor <a href="/cast-and-crew/shasta-grenier">Shasta Grenier</a>, and film subjects Erik Goodge and Elliott Miller.</p>

<p>The schedule also can be found at ebertfest.com, complete with Ebert's reviews, information about other events, and a video retrospective from last year's festival. Also available on the website at the time of the event will be live streaming of panel discussions and the post-film Q-and-A sessions at the Virginia Theater.</p>

<p>The festival is an event of the College of Media at Illinois. Additional support is provided by the Champaign County Anti-Stigma Alliance, sponsoring "In the Family"; Steak 'n Shake, sponsoring "Blancanieves," and The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</p>

<p>Ebert is a Pulitzer Prize-winning critic for the Chicago Sun-Times and co-hosted "Ebert &amp; Roeper," a weekly televised movie-review program, until 2006. He also produced and contributed to "Ebert Presents at the Movies," which ran through 2011.</p>

<p>Ebert is a 1964 Illinois journalism graduate and adjunct journalism professor.</p>

<p>Ebert selects films for the festival that he feels have been overlooked in some way, either by critics, distributors or audiences, or because they come from overlooked genres or formats, such as documentaries. (The festival previously was called "Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival." It was renamed in 2008.)</p>

<p>Guests connected with the selected films appear on stage for informal Q-and-A sessions after the screenings. Also attending and participating in panel discussions will be members of Ebert's "far flung correspondents," a group of film commentators from all over the world who regularly contribute to his online journal. </p>

<p>As in recent festivals, Ebert's wife, Chaz, will act as the emcee. Ebert will play a role through his computer-assisted voice.</p>

<p>Tickets for individual films will go on sale beginning April 1 through the theater box office (phone 217-356-9063; fax: 217-356-5729; open 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday-Friday) and online through the theater website. The price will be $14 each for regular admission and $12 each for students and senior citizens. Sales will be limited to four per person.</p>

<p>The 1,000 festival passes, covering all festival screenings, went on sale in November and usually sell out -- though a few remain available.</p>

<p>Even if tickets for individual films are sold out, entrance can usually be obtained by waiting in a designated line that forms outside the theater prior to each screening.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I have watched with a kind of petrified fascination in recent years as the world creeps closer to what looks to me like disastrous climate change. The poles are melting. Ocean levels are rising. The face of the planet is torn by unprecedented natural disasters. States of emergency have become so routine that governors always seem to be proclaiming one. Do they have drafts of proclamations on file?
</p><p>The political responses to this condition seem to fall along party lines. Democrats think legislation is needed Republicans don't want the feds interfering with private enterprise. Vested interests weigh in. Pork barrel projects are protected by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Washington fiddles. Earth burns.
</p><p>
I get stirred up more than many people, because I see so many documentaries. Yes, they're "biased." There's much less motivation for an "unbiased" documentary. Docs are usually made by people who have something they think you should know. There is little motivation for objectivity, something people forget when yet another doc comes along. And there are so many causes! Genetically modified crops! Chemical fertilizers! Trademarked genomes! The downside to wind power! An explosive-blowing doc like <b> <a href="http://dld.bz/cqWud"></a>
Chasing Ice </b> comes along, and hardly causes a stir.</p>
<p>	I write an entry. It rounds up the usual comments. We're stuck. Just today, however, a glimmer of hope shone on the political front. I read on Bloomberg: "President Barack Obama is preparing to tell all federal agencies for the first time that they should consider the impact on global warming before approving major projects, from pipelines to highways."</p>
<p>	"Consider." Not the most electrifying word I can imagine. Yet consider the response. I read on: "It's got us very freaked out," said Ross Eisenberg, vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers, a Washington-based group that represents 11,000 companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Southern Co. The standards, which constitute guidance for agencies and not new regulations, are set to be issued in the coming weeks, according to lawyers briefed by administration officials.</p>
<p>	"Freaked out." You know what has me freaked out? I consider it a real possibility that millions now living will die as a result of the interests of the National Association of Manufacturers and its 11,000 members. </p>

<p>
Sally Potter's new film centers on two teenage British girls (<a href="/cast-and-crew/elle-fanning">Elle Fanning</a> and <a href="/cast-and-crew/alice-englert">Alice Englert</a> ) who get involved in the Ban the Bomb movement at the time of the Cuban missile crisis. I remember that time. On a weekday afternoon, Soviet warships bearing missiles were approaching a line drawn in the sea by President Kennedy. If they crossed it, JFK had vowed retaliation. Would our missiles take flight? Would the Soviet bloc Would there be war? We felt so powerless. Craning my neck to see over the heads of the crowd, I was jammed into the front lounge of the University YMCA. At a time like that you do not<i>--you cannot--</i>want to be alone.</p>
<p>This time the line has not been drawn on a map. This time the enemy, if we can use the word in this context, is an American lobbyist group. They seem focused on maximizing profits and shareholder benefits, at the cost of any environmental conscience. It seems possible that their policies will lead to a different kind of seasonal calendar. Instead of Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall, this new generation will know Blizzard, Flood, Heat and Fire. Month follows month as the seasons tear themselves apart.</p>

    <title>Outguess Ebert winner: A flawless performance</title>

      <![CDATA[<p><img alt="Thumb_eb20130313commentary130319997ar" src="http://static.rogerebert.com/uploads/blog_post/primary_image/rogers-journal/outguess-ebert-winner-a-flawless-performance/thumb_EB20130313COMMENTARY130319997AR.jpg" /></p><p>Alex Kazhinsky of Lincolnwood is this year's Grand Prize winner in the annual Outguess Ebert contest — and tells me, "It's a big thrill to win your contest after playing it for so many years!"</p>

<p>	Kazhinsky had a perfect score across all the categories. "For many years," he says,  "I have worked as an actor in Chicago's entertainment industry. I've had speaking roles in independent films, web series, and commercials. Some of my most notable roles are the following:</p>

<p>	• A corrupt Chicago Alderman named Cunningham in the web series "<a href="http://tinyurl.com/DaWiseguysEp4">DaWiseguys</a>."</p>

<p>	•Uncle Steve in the short film "<a href="http://tinyurl.com/ElephantFilm">When I Was An Elephant</a>," which won the award for Best Branded Film at the 2011 Chicago International Film Festival. </p>

<p>	•  Russian crime boss in the short film "<a href="http://tinyurl.com/MomentFilm">The Moment</a>."   </p>

<p>	"Because I'm an actor," he says,  "the only thing I'll say about my age is that I'm in my 30s."</p>

<p>	He's been playing the contest since the 1992 Oscars, for the year 1991: "That was the year in which "The Silence of the Lambs" won five Oscars, including Best Picture. "Very few people saw that coming. I think I scored only 2 or 3 out of 9 in your contest that year."</p>

<p>"Back in the year 2000 (for the film year 1999), I got 9 out of 9 in your contest. For the tie-breaker question, I said that 'American Beauty' would win the most Oscars, with 6. It won 5. So, I came very close to getting a perfect score. And I would've gotten a perfect score last year if <a href="/cast-and-crew/viola-davis">Viola Davis</a> had beaten <a href="/cast-and-crew/meryl-streep">Meryl Streep</a> in the Best Actress category."</p>

<p>	I asked, "If you were awarding the Oscars, who would win for best actress?" His reply suggests a certain degree of sheer blind luck: "Unfortunately, I haven't actually seen any of the films nominated in any of the 24 categories, except for the Bond film "Skyfall." So, I can't really say which performance, film, or directorial effort I prefer over another.</p>

<p>	"However, I was cheering for <a href="/cast-and-crew/jennifer-lawrence">Jennifer Lawrence</a> to win, not just because I picked her for your contest, but also because of her beauty, charm, and great personality. I saw her in 'The Hunger Games' and in 'House at the End of the Street,' and she was fantastic in both films. She certainly brings out the charm in her interviews."</p>

<p>	His advice (which apparently doesn't involve seeing the films, but never mind, lots of people haven't seen the all): "Perform research. This is true whether you have seen the nominated films or not. In recent years, I have visited various websites where the Oscars were discussed. Some websites listed odds for various categories. Other websites kept people up to speed on all of the precursor awards. I also followed online message boards where people analyzed everything ad infinitum.</p>

<p>	"This year, there were a LOT of hard categories. Perhaps the hardest were Adapted Screenplay and Best Actress. For Adapted Screenplay, 'Lincoln' was the first front-runner. Then <a href="/cast-and-crew/david-o-russell">David O. Russell</a> won the BAFTA. Because of the BAFTA (British) Award and Russell's immense popularity with the actors branch of the Academy (the largest branch), Russell seemingly became the new front-runner. Then, 'Argo' won the WGA precursor award, and therefoe became the front-runner.</p>

<p>	"In the Best Actress category, Jennifer Lawrence seemed to be a lock to win, until Emmenuelle Riva won the BAFTA. Then it became neck-and-neck between Lawrence and Riva."</p>

<p>	I recent years, Kazhinsky said, "I've watched movies primarily in two theaters: the AMC Showplace Village Crossing 18, at the Village Crossing shopping mall in Skokie, and the Century Evanston 12 in Evanston. When I was a kid, I would watch movies at the Lincoln Village Theater and at the Plaza Theatre, both in Chicago."</p>

<p>	"There's a theory that in contests like the Illinois State Lottery, it increases your chances if you buy a ticket at a store that sells lots of winning tickets. Whether that works he is doubtful, because a degree of skill is at least presumably required."</p>

<p>	His five favorite films, the ones that excite him the most, are these (in no order):  1) "Star Wars --Episode IV: A New Hope";  2) "Die Hard 2"; 3) "A View to a Kill" ("<a href="/cast-and-crew/roger-moore">Roger Moore</a> is my favorite Bond. Plus, the film has action sequences at the North Pole, the Eiffel Tower, the streets of Paris, and the Golden Gate Bridge, and great music from Duran Duran"; 4) "<a href="/reviews/speed-1994">Speed</a>"; and 5) "<a href="/reviews/great-movie-saturday-night-fever-1977">Saturday Night Fever</a>." </p>

<p>	Kazhinsky's Gtrand Prize includes a round trip for two from Delta Vacations, and hotel and accomodations to the World Premiere of Marvel's "<a href="/reviews/iron-man-3-2013">Iron Man 3</a>," starring <a href="/cast-and-crew/robert-downey">Robert Downey</a>, Jr. He'll also win a Marvel gift package. And I'm throwing in an autographed copy of my new "Roger Ebert's Movie Yearbook 2013," which includes my reviews of more than 800 new films, so he can get an early start on the 2014 Outguess concert.</p>]]>

<p>When I was a graduate student at the University of Chicago, I must have driven past the little park a few times. Hyde Park, where the University is located, is a neighborhood including fraternity houses, foundation headquarters, school department offices, even President Obama's family home. Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House can be found there, and Henry Moore's chilling death's-sculpture marking the place where scientists first split the atom.

It is a mile or so away from the Obama home. On Jan. 29, a young woman and her friends took cover from the rain under one of the park's canopies like you can see above. A gang member jumped from a car and started firing on her group. </p><p>
A bullet in her back ended the life of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old senior honor student a King College Prep High. She had just finished taking her final exams. One week earlier, she and a group from her school performed at the Obama Inauguration ceremonies. Police speculated that her group was considered to be poaching on another gang's turf.</p><p>	I knew when I began this would be the shortest blog entry I have ever written. I simply wanted to put down what happened.</p><p>	I'm all out of arguments. I have noting to say about the Second Amendment. Nothing about the Founding Fathers. All out. No discussion about Chicago as a murder capitol, or where the guns come, or why. Finished with those. The day of Hadiya's death was a cold, wet day. A sad day What could we as a society have done to prevent it from happening?</p>]]>

    <title>How I am a Roman Catholic</title>

      <![CDATA[<p><img alt="Thumb_4_roger_20altar_20boy-2-thumb-470x425-59311" src="http://static.rogerebert.com/uploads/blog_post/primary_image/rogers-journal/how-i-am-a-roman-catholic/thumb_4_Roger_20altar_20boy-2-thumb-470x425-59311.jpg" /></p><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>On Thursday morning, February 28, I found CNN featuring a continuous shot of a helicopter. The network cut between a close-up and a distant dot. It was Benedict, flying from the Vatican City. This was extraordinary attention for an ordinary cardinal, because as Benedict told the throng awaiting him, "I am no longer Pope." I am not a scholar of Catholic history, but I believe we were witnessing the first time the Papal throne was vacant while an elected Pope was alive.
</p><p>"This no one can deny," wise Sister Rosanne told us during the 8 am theology class that began every day at St. Mary's Grade School. "The Church is the oldest continuously functioning institution in human history, and the Popes go back in an unbroken chain to St. Peter's blessing at the hand of Jesus." That was one reason people of all faiths or none desired an audience with the Pope. Or, as the fabled Chicago columnist Irv Kupcinet famously recalled it, "my audition with the Pope." How I wish I could find a photograph of the great moment, with Kup's wife Essie and her inscrutable smile. She had been photographed with kings, queens, Presidents, emperors and even Marilyn Monroe. Now this.
</p><p>
It was a little eerie. Benedict would sleep tonight in the summer residence of a man who no longer existed. The drive to Castel Gandolfo, down an avenue of genuflecting trees, led a procession of post-Papal limousines around a graveled drive and deposited a white-haired 85-year-old into the hands of polished young men all dressed in black, like pallbearers. His twitter account at @Pontifex read only "Sede Vacante," or "empty seat." From an encyclical to this.</p>
<p>	The morning hour in religion was my favorite class. As we advanced through the grades, it began simply, in memorizing chapters from the Baltimore Catechism, and concluded in eighth grade with the four lives of Christ as told in the New Testament. We made a side tour through Genesis, observing it's "all the Jews have," but cautioning that it was written as a fable not to be taken literally. Some Protestants took it as fundamentalist truth, but not Catholics or modern Jews. </p>
<p>That led us toward the Theory of Evolution, which in its elegance and blinding obviousness became one of the pillars of my reasoning, explaining so many things in so many ways. It was an introduction not only to logic but to symbolism, thus opening a window into poetry, literature and the arts in general. All my life I have deplored those who interpret something only on its most simplistic level. I grant you that artworks like Andres Serrano's "Piss Christ" are hard to embrace and you will never find it displayed in my home, but I understand the impulse behind it. </p>
<p><i>Fr. J. W. McGinn at St. Patrick's Church in Urbana, with Pat Conerty, me and Bill Miller. At no time did I experiece or hear about sexual abuse in our Champaign-Urbana parishes.<img src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/how-i-am-a-roman-catholic/ebert_20blaze-thumb-350x280-59314.jpg" width="350" height="280" alt="ebert blaze.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></i></p>
<p>	The nuns at St. Mary's were Dominicans They lived in a small square convent behind the school, holding six nuns (some taught two grades) and a cook and their housekeeping nun, who kept a sharp eye trained on us through her screen door. We had humble playground equipment, a swing set and two basketball hoops. Our principal sport was playing King of the World. This involved two boys standing on a log, each trying to push the other off. The housekeeper would open the screen door and shout, "If you break your necks, you have only yourselves to blame."</p>
<p>	It was from these nuns, especially Sister Nathan and Sister Rosanne, that I learned my core moral and political principles. I assumed they were Roman Catholic dogma. Many of them involved a Social Contract between God and man, which represented classical liberalism based on empathy and economic fairness. We heard much of Leo XIII's encyclical "Rerum Novarum"--"On Capital and Labor." When I hear self-appointed Catholic "spokesmen" like William Donohue of the Catholic League, I wonder if he has come across it in his reading.</p>
<p>	Through a mental process that has by now become almost instinctive, those nuns guided me into supporting Universal Health Care, the rightness of labor unions, fair taxation, prudence in warfare, kindness in peacetime, help for the hungry and homeless, and equal opportunity for the races and genders. It continues to surprise me that many who consider themselves religious seem to tilt away from me. </p>
<p><i>With my non-practicing Lutheran father Walter on Confirmation Day. at my grandmother's house, in second grade.</i><img src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/how-i-am-a-roman-catholic/dad_20and_20confirmtion-thumb-290x321-59317.jpg" width="290" height="321" alt="dad and confirmtion.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p>
<p>	There are areas of disagreement. Is homosexuality a sin? In grade school circa 1950 we never discussed it, and I had never heard of it. By the upper grades I'd read about it in the novels of Thomas Wolfe and James Baldwin, but had little idea of the mechanics involved. Today the Church continues to regard it as a sin (not particularly rare in the priesthood, indeed rumored to be found even within the confines of Benedict's Vatican). His resignation might be related to weariness at his age at the prospect of dealing with a gay scandal not of his doing. My feeling is that love between consenting adults is admirable. The commandment about not coveting thy neighbor's wife had more to do with concepts of property in Old Testament times, preserved to this day in such fundamentalist societies as Saudi Arabia. In current practice that commandment has been twisted to political convenience, as our Second Amendment has been adapted to the convenience of gun lovers.</p>
<p>	The great scandal in today's Church is of course child abuse. I have no idea what such surveys mean or what they're based on, but given how much I've read about it I was surprised to learn that only a little more than four percent of today's clergy seems to have been involved in it.</p>
<p>	Birth control? Here I subscribe to an unofficial "double" loophole often applied in practice by Catholics faced with perplexing choices: Do that which results in the greater good and the lesser evil. I support freedom of choice. My choice is to not support abortion, except in cases of a clear-cut choice between the lives of the mother and child. A child conceived through incest or rape is innocent and deserves the right to be born.</p>
<p>	I consider myself Catholic, lock, stock and barrel, with this technical loophole: I cannot believe in God. I refuse to call myself a atheist however, because that indicates too great a certainty about the unknowable. My beliefs were formed long ago from good-hearted Dominican sisters, and many better-qualified RCs might disagree. One of the few Catholic priests I've known well is my Michigan neighbor Fr. Andrew Greeley. On Saturday afternoons on his bluff overlooking Lake Michigan he would celebrate Mass for a congregation occasionally containing some Daleys. Greeley wrote an outspoken liberal column for the Sun-Times and other papers, and his 1981 novel <i>Cardinal Sins</i> helped bring about the downfall of Chicago's John Cardinal Cody.</p>
<p>	One Saturday after Mass he invited me and our friend John McHugh to join him as he threw some steaks on the grill. The conversation arrived at the appearance of Our Lady near the town of Knock, where a controversial airport was built, large enough to handle 747s. What was Greeley's opinion?</p>
<p>	"The appearance that seems most persuasive," he said, "was at Lourdes, where she was short, dark, dressed humbly in brown, and asked us to love another. Many of the other times, she is tall, blonde, well-dressed in blue and white, and asks us to vote Republican."</p>

    <title>Endemic hunger in history's wealthiest nation</title>

      <![CDATA[<p><img alt="Thumb_eb20130228commentary130229975ar" src="http://static.rogerebert.com/uploads/blog_post/primary_image/rogers-journal/endemic-hunger-in-historys-wealthiest-nation/thumb_EB20130228COMMENTARY130229975AR.jpg" /></p><p><b>by Omer M. Mozaffar</b></p>
<p>When we imagine global hunger, we often think of dusty, loosely clad, skeletal Africans sitting outside tents, moving in slow motion as flies hover around them. The documentary, "<a href="/reviews/a-place-at-the-table-2013">A Place at the Table</a>," makes it clear, however, that hunger is very much an American problem, too. It is one of the central challenges of life in the United States today. Some fifty million Americans are underfed. That is one out of six. When we speak of children, however, the stats get even worse: one out of four children, in history's wealthiest nation, now suffers from hunger. </p>
<p>The most common problem is not food scarcity, but "food instability." Simply put, the availabity of meals can be static and unpredictable. A child does not know when he or she will eat next. A second is the "food desert," the long distances residents may have to travel to obtain basic healthy produce and protein. The next is malnutrition, either a lack of food or the consumption of "empty calories" that don't offer essential nourishment.</p>
<p>The crisis affects all types of people in all corners of the country. Rosie, a gradeschooler in Colorado, is seemingly full of energy behind her little pair of glasses. At first glance, she appears to be a normal kid. But she suffers from such hunger that she gets headaches in class. </p>
<p>Elsewhere, budget cuts have reduced a small-town police force to a single officer, who isn't paid enough to feed himself. He has to join the crowds packing into the local church cafeteria for regular meals. </p>
<p>In Philadelphia, Barbie is a mother who happily takes her children to school and works as an advocate drawing attention to hunger matters. Her youngest son suffers from brain developmental issues and needs healthy food, but she cannot afford it. She earns just enough to disqualify her for public aid, yet not enough to consistently feed her children healthy food.</p>
<p>Public aid provides just a few dollars for many families to feed each of their children. In Mississipi, Tremonica, an obese second-grader, walks into a mobile medical office for a checkup. She's out of breath and suffers from asthma, which has been linked to junk food diets. She's overweight but malnourished because her mother can't afford to feed her fresh produce, which is more expensive than processed foods loaded with preservatives. </p>
<p>“A Place at the Table” takes a straightforward approach to its subject, without painting villains. Rather, it effectively argues that American hunger is a result of poverty and policy, not lack of food. America has more than enough agricultural capacity to feed everyone on a regular basis. But our current systems do not appropriately address need: thousands of families do not receive enough financial support to feed their families, either because the amount is so small, or because the income limits exclude parents with full-time jobs. </p>
<p>In addition, the government subsidizes farms to reduce production, which inflates the costs of fruits, vegetables, and meat. Further, giant agribusiness corporations sell inexpensive processed foods that harms children. Their lobbies are so strong that they are almost unstoppable. </p>
<p>I wish that the film could offer an innovative solution to these problems, but perhaps that is the point. This is a national crisis, requiring many methods of repair. Celebrities like <a href="/cast-and-crew/jeff-bridges">Jeff Bridges</a> and Tom Colicchio, the producer of television's <i>Top Chef</i>, help bring awareness to these injustices. One grade-school teacher makes house calls, paying out of her own pocket to stock her students' refrigerators. Another grade-school teacher finds ways to teach her own children about diet. Others travel to Washington to affect policy. This is a beautifully photographed, hopeful film, though its startling statistics indicate the troubles it chronicles will get far worse before they get better.</p>]]>

<p><b><i>Note: This entry contains several high-quality embedded videos. It's necessary to give them time to load before attempting to view *any* of them. </i></b> </p>
<p></p>
<p>Searching for mention of "<a href="/reviews/amour-2013">Amour</a>" on our 2012 PBS program "Ebert Presents at the Movies," I was pointed by Google to one of Chaz's video reports. I remembered liking her video at the time, started noodling through all of her reports, and found myself thinking of my wife's emerging role as a movie critic. For more than 20 years, she's attended virtually every film festival and press screening with me, debated the films, made friends with the people.
</p><p>I even proposed marriage to her, in 1990 during Cannes. There's a story there. On the last Sunday of the festival, when just about everything was behind us, we rented a car because I wanted to show Chaz the grave of my great hero, Edward Lear. We drove above Nice, turned right at Italy, and just across the border came upon San Remo, where the artist and writer lies buried with his servant Giogiro and his cat, Old Foss.
</p><p>
Returning to Cannes, we dipped down to Monte Carlo. The grandstands were still in place after the Grand Prix, there was a cafe still open, and there I offered my hand in marriage and she accepted.
This event not only brought about the happiest event of my lifetime, but also taught me a lesson: <i>Propose marriage only at a place you want to return to time and again.</i> Monte Carlo is not that place. After Cannes we were moving on to Venice and London, both splendid choices. Why couldn't I have waited for a few days? Indeed, in 2000, on a sentimental trip back to Monte Carlo, we found the sacred cafe had been temporary.</p>
<p>What I found in watching these videos as a group was that Chaz looks great on camera, and has an ideal television voice: Deep, warm, rich. She was the founder and executive producer of "Ebert Presents," and made these videos with director Scott Dummler and Andrew Suprenant, designer of the show's web site.</p>
<p>They also made Annette Insdorf's videos for the program, embedded here. Annette, head of the film department at Columbia University, co-hosted Bravo's coverage of the Cannes awards ceremony with me for years. Together, I think there's a good overview here of the many sides of the festival. I'm also adding Chaz's report from the Marrakech Film Festival, with Chaz joined by our Far-Flung Correspondent Kim Richardson.

<p>	</p>
<p>After she had the heart attack out in Michigan on Thanksgiving 1988, I stood by her bedside in the recovery room and she tried <i>so hard </i>to tell me something, but it just didn't work. I loved her so much. Did she know how much? I never told her. There are always questions you wish you'd asked after it's too late to get an answer. Sometimes years can pass before you realize they're questions.
</p><p>
Everyone said I "took after her," and I did. My features are more rounded than anyone else on either side of my family. Martha R. Stumm was the youngest of six surviving children of a Dutch-Irish-German couple who raised their family on a farm outside Tayorville, Illinois. Years after after her father died and her mother opened a boarding house in Urbana, enough oil was found beneath the land to make it worth drilling. </p>
<p>I visited the farm in the 1960s with my mom and dad, Aunt Martha, and Cousin Bernardine from Stonington. It was a two-story frame house on a smallish footprint. Wallpaper was still hanging from the walls. They remembered their pony that lived in the barn, and they followed the path they ran on barefoot down to the river. Their dad was not only a farmer but ran a billiard parlor in Taylorville, and took out witty wisecracks in the classified section of the local paper.
</p><p>
I don't have all the years straight in my mind, but I know they lost the farm in the Depression, right before or after my grandfather died. My grandmother, Anna B. Stumm, made the move to Urbana and started the student board ing house to be sure her children would get a chance at university degrees. I recall Grandma as a pleasant old lady who got along with everybody. I never saw the sturdy determination she must have needed as a bankrupt single parent with six kids, setting down roots on a long shot during hard times.</p>

<p>
My Uncle Everett graduated from the University of Illinois, and eventually became vice president of a building supplies company near Chicago. Once he took me down into one of his gravel pits, with its awesome walls and enormous equipment. My <a href="/cast-and-crew/uncle-bill">Uncle Bill</a> graduated from the College of Agriculture, and became an ag teacher first in Elkhart, Indiana, and then in Elkhart, Illinois. Once at the State Fair he showed me the pen at the fair holding some of his classes' prize cows, and the cots he and his students slept on overnight. Everett was the only Republican in the family, which caused not rancor but amusement at family dinners.</p>
<p>
Bill, a lifelong bachelor, gave me <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> when everyone thought I was too young to read it, but I wasn't. He gave me books every Christmas and birthday. Every time there was a family gathering at Grandma's house, it was understood that time would be set aside "for Bill and Roger to have one of their talks." When he was around 90, Bill became angry at Martha and our family friends Dave and Dot Sparrow because they wouldn't allow him to ride a mule to the bottom of the Grand Canyon, "Hell's bells," he said, "At my age, if anything happens, the mule has more to lose." He did all of the cooking for family gatherings, even for Martha's last Thanksgiving, although she loved her apron that said, <i>This is the kitchen of Martha R. Stumm. If you doubt it, start something."</i></p>

<p>
My third uncle, Bob, also spent his life at the University, mostly as a janitor at the Library. He wasn't as bright as the others. He was in charge of killing and plucking turkeys, capons and chickens in the garage, or of setting up and supervising the ice cream machine, and maintaining the house, where he lived in a cold enclosed front porch. For most of the years I remember, Martha's friend Jean also lived with them. Bob smoked Luckies and when I asked why the chickens ran around with their heads chopped off, he said, "That's to make little boys like you ask questions." When I started a stamp collection, he sorted through the library's discarded mail for foreign stamps, which he would give me one at a time. This continued for some years after I stopped collecting stamps. When I mentioned that to my mother, she said, "Honey, that means so much to Bob. Don't ever say anything."</p>
<p>
Girls didn't often go to college in those days. I believe high schools in the 1930s in a town like Champaign-Urbana produced graduates that were better-educated and more literate than a great many of today's college students. My Aunt Mary, whose recipes are cited in my book <i>The Pot and How to Use It, </i>married John O'Neill, a dashing state trooper who later became Champaign Postmaster. He, like my parents and everyone except Everett, was a diehard Democrat. That he was able to win a clout-controlled job like postmaster, in a district that was long Republican and still is, says a good deal about the fact that "everybody loves Johnny." He and Mary were childless, and lived in a series of homes they would "improve" and resell every two or three years. They ended up with half a floor of a condo with an actual elevator, overlooking the park at the end of the street where Ebertfest is held. </p>
<p><i>John, Martha, and my football</i></p>

<p>
They were "in with those Champaign society people." They were even members of the Champaign Country Club. There was nothing snobbish about them. They were always laughing. He smoked Camels and Mary smoked Pall Malls. Why do I mention their brands? I have never smoked, but all of my life I've remembered the smokes people use. It must be a mental quirk. How clearly I recall a day when my mother and I had just pulled up in Grandma's driveway and Mary walked over to chat through my window and was holding a cigarette that was <i>the longest cigarette I had ever seen.</i> Why does that memory still appear uninvited in my mind? A quirky pre-sexual tremor run through my young body. Why? </p>
<p>I have a lot of mental snapshots that pop up. They usually aren't significant and are unrelated to what's going on at the time: Jackie Yates and me occupying the entire floor of our dining room with a construction-paper village to go with my Lionel Train Set. Bitter tears of resentment when it had to be torn down when we had company for dinner. You'd think it was Venice. Slowly letting the first cold drops of a Grapette trickle down my throat while sitting on my bike leaning against the porch of Harry Rusk's grocery store. A girl named Vicki walking past me in a hallway at Urbana High and deliberately allowing her breasts to brush <i>pop! pop!</i> across my arm. A disloyal thought, quickly dismissed in shame, when Vicki said she'd "see me" at the Tiger's Den on Friday night, and I realized I'd be attending Grandmother's wake.</p>
<p>
Daddy observed that John had put Mary to lifelong labor "redecorating" houses he could sell at a profit. "Mary loves it," my mom said. "She loves to shop. If Johnny didn't give her a new house every two years, she'd go crazy." I remember seeing a Rose Bowl game after she bought a TV set. We listened to the radio while John fiddled with rabbit ears to pull in a signal from Peoria. At a time when Champaign-Urbana lacked a TV station, Mary had purchased the TV because "everybody has them in Better Homes and Gardens." Their house at that early point after Johnny's purchase was still mostly unfurnished, and most of the guests sat on folding chairs while I squatted on the floor in front of the set, squinting at distant ghostly images that Marc Howard or Larry Stewart on WDWS would say represented another great run by J. C. Caroline.</p>
<p><i>Aunt Martha and me in my house on Fullerton.</i></p>
<p><img src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/what-was-my-aunt-martha-trying-to-ask-me/martha_20and_20me-thumb-300x242-59005.jpg" width="300" height="242" alt="martha and me.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p>
<p>	My mother attended the secretarial college on Green Street and studied bookkeeping. She became assistant manager of the Allied Finance Company, upstairs over the Champaign County Bank and Trust. "People get their loans turned down by the bank," the owner, Mr. R. V. Willis explained," and they only have to climb up one flight of stairs to find us." Loans were $25 to $500. My mother and another employee were sometimes sent out to repossess cars that were "behind." Their big day was New Year's, when the books always had to be perfectly in balance. Then Mr. Willis would take his employees and their families two doors down to Mel Root's, where Mr. Willis would tell my dad, "Have yourself a steak, Wally," and he'd say, "I sure will!" I always ordered french fried shrimp that came in a Shrimp Basket with a side of "cold slaw." </p>
<p>	My Aunt Martha went to the nursing school of Mercy Hospital, in Urbana, and became a registered nurse. She had a white nursing hat she wore on the job which made her look ready for action. She worked for years for Dr. Edmond Collins, a dental surgeon at Christie Clinic. The pain of having my teeth drilled was less for me because Doctor Collins and I were serious Tarzan fans. "They have a town named Tarzana in California," he informed me. He was a kindly man with a dry, sarcastic voice, and he and Martha got along famously. "Roger gives me someone to talk with about Tarzan," he told Martha. After the original book, our favorites were <i>Tarzan and the Ant Men</i> and <i>Tarzan and the Golden Lion.</i> On one of my birthdays he blew me away by giving me <i>Tarzan at the Earth's Core, </i> which introduced me to Burrough's land of Pellucidar. Years later, after his retirement to California, he'd write me from time to time. He still loved Tarzan. Writing after Martha died, he said he would have come to the funeral but be couldn't travel anymore. "I never met another nurse quite like her," he said. </p>
<p>
Some dates grow unclear. Martha and Jean Sabo met in nursing school. Martha was engaged to a local boy, whose name I think was Willis Hartrick, who went away in the Navy and died when his ship was struck by Japanese torpedoes and went down in sharky waters. After the war, she dated a man named Rex Smith, I think, who would pick her up for their square dancing club wearing cowboy duds. His thick black hair was neatly parted and cemented into place with Brilliantine.</p>
<p>	Jean Sabo was an Army nurse, assigned to a hospital train in Europe. I took the map of Europe out of one of our National Geographic magazines, and she used a Crayola to trace her train's journeys. Bill was then stationed with the Army in Casablanca. Jean moved back to town and at some point in the 1950s and took an apartment. After Grandma's children bought the new house at 807 W. Clark for her, she moved in. That house was always known as "home." My Mom would tell Daddy: "I'm going over home." Jean and Martha lived together for the rest of Martha's life. Bob's emphysema grew worse and spent the rest of his days in the Champaign County Nursing Home. Every time we visited him there, in his spartan room with an ignored roommate, my mother would say, "That's where I'll end up. The County Home." She never quite thought I had a real job. "And how is Roger?" her friends would ask. "Is he still just...going to the movies?"</p>
<p><img src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/what-was-my-aunt-martha-trying-to-ask-me/nursing_20cap_202-thumb-280x408-59008.jpg" width="280" height="408" alt="nursing cap 2.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p>
<p>	Although they later became friendly, my mother was very disturbed by Jean's moving in with Martha, Bob and Grandma. I overheard conversations after bedtime about "how much we're helping Mom," and how much that money was "helping Jean"--although registered nurses made good salaries, and Grandma now had two of them around the clock. Grandma simply accepted Jean. Bob would sit in his enclosed porch reading Popular Mechanics, in whose pages I paid close study to the stamp company offering <i>FREE GOYA NUDE!</i> The rest of the time Bob devoted such close supervision of television management that you'd think he was still trying to pull in Peoria. Before we finally got our own set, we would ritualistically gather in Grandma's living room to watch <i>I Love Lucy, <a href="/cast-and-crew/jackie-gleason">Jackie Gleason</a></i>and <i> Talk of the Town, with Ed Sullivan.</i> Before the first show came on, Bob would supervise the watching of the test pattern. He never mentioned it, but I could tell Uncle Bob was quietly annoyed when people talked during the test pattern. In some sense, he was presenting television, not CBS. He'd bought it out of his own salary.</p>
<p>Grandma was recognized as the ultimate authority in the Clark house. Bob was the male in charge. Martha laid down the law and made the plans. As the youngest, she was used to getting her way. This included choosing the family friends. I cannot recall Uncle Bob ever having a single friend that I met. He was of few words. Perhaps he had lunch sometimes with another janitor.</p>
<p><i>Bill, Gene Walsh, me, Dot Sparrow, my mother, Dave Sparrow, Martha, Jean Sabo In my house on Fullerton</i></p>

<p>
Martha and Jean were the world's friends. Half a block east on Clark street, directly behind St. Patrick's, a black family lived, and their mother, Jean and Martha were constantly dinner guests at one house or the other. There was Joanie Kim, a Korean-American nurse, Martha met at Christie Clinic. It was assumed she would be at Grandma's table on Friday nights. In our kitchen she made Korean BBQ for us. Bob would get up and go to the fridge, where he found a bottle of American BBQ sauce to slather over it.</p>
<p>Another frequent guest was Florence Ebert, also a nurse at Christie, who drew my blood for the first time I can recall. She was the daughter of Herman Ebert, who was some sort of cousin of Daddy's. Florence lived until 88, and I saw her once a year at Ebertfest, always on the arm of Katie Birch, a younger nurse. Martha and Jean also made a pal of Gene Walsh, a local woman who lived alone in an apartment across from the McKinley YMCA and always came along when we went out for dinner in Champaign-Urbana, or Michigan after my mother's death. "Walsh," as she was called, was picked up and delivered home in a big van piloted by Dave and Dot Sparrow. The Sparrows essentially made this van available as a transport vehicle for Martha and her friends. </p>
<p>
Dave and Dot. "Have Dave build you a deck," Martha advised me after I bought the house in New Buffalo. "Those people are true blue." They'd met the Sparrows after moving to Wapella. They needed someone to add a sun porch to their housd, hired Dave, and got lifelong friends in the bargain. Dave and Dot now joined Fr. Brunskill at the table at all dinners I attended in Wapella, and inevitably many more. </p>
<p>Dave and Dot lived in nearby Kenney, Illinois (pop. 374), Dave was the Water Commissioner. There was a certain irony in the fact that when they wanted to add on a room and there was only one side of the house it would work on, it was positioned over their unused well. "You never know when you might need it again," said the Water Commis=sioner, and built the floor over the old well, with a lid he could open in the new room's rug. They had a <i>lot</i> of relatives near Kenney. Their enormous nearly square dining table was surrounded on Sundays by a circulating population of relatives, family, neighbors and friends. One relative was the chief of police, and Dave had a police band radio so the whole table could monitor the calls, which were not that many, and triggerdd a running commentary: <i>That will be over by the time they get there...she's having her baby...that kid isn'y old enough to have a license...</i></p>
<p><i>Martha and her sister, my mother, Annabel.</i></p>
<p><img src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/what-was-my-aunt-martha-trying-to-ask-me/martha_20and_20mom__20wapella-thumb-300x214-59015.jpg" width="300" height="214" alt="martha and mom, wapella.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p>
<p>Dave was the high-tech version of Uncle Bob. He was the first person I knew who had one of those big satellite dishes with an electric motor to rotate it. He subscribed to a thick satellite TV guide and enjoyed in bringing in Tokyo and London. I'd come a long way from bringing in Peoria. </p>
<p>Dave and Dot adopted the family. His big van was used for trips to the Grand Canyon, and he ferried Martha, Jean and Bill to visit me in Chicago and Michigan. When they were living in my side cottage in Michigan, they drove up most weekends whether or not I was in residence, staying at a motel. I piled into the van with them and we visited the big antique mall in Niles and the Chinese buffet in Michigan City. I felt at home. After Martha died, they drove Uncle Bill and Walsh to visit me in Michigan, keeping the ritual alive. Dave and my best friend, bonded over computersMcHugh with the Tandy Model 100. These memories reflect the nature of ordinary life Downstate as I experienced it. What remarkable friendships they created after 60. What good people they were, and how well they demonstrated how easily people loved my Aunt Martha and Jean. And what was the nature of the friendship between Martha and Jean, which spanned more than 30 years?</p>

<p>
That's one of the questions I never asked. For years, it was a question I didn't know even existed. <a href="/cast-and-crew/alice-munro">Alice Munro</a> had a short story about two women presenting such a question. In my mind, I've answered this in an indirect way involving the way they were both serious Catholics, especially Jean. On Clark Street they were only a good block's walk from the back door of St. Patrick's on Main street, and would never miss a First Friday or a Holy Day of Obligation. I can't be sure they ever worked it out for themselves. Possibly they discussed the details of their living arrangements with Grandma and their siblings, but I picture these talks as running along the lines of "It makes good sense." </p>
<p>Here is a curious thing. I remember the house on Clark Street so clearly, right down to the smell of green onions in the basement. You entered through the enclosed porch, thick with the stale aroma of Uncle Bob's Luckies, and into the dining room, where I clearly recall Bob helping me to walk while steadying myself on the business end of a fly-swatter he held. To the left off the dining room was the kitchen, where I remember being at the kitchen table on Martha's lap, while Grandma and my mother supervised. She had one of my legs pinned between hers, and would lift a bite of food to my mouth and squeeze. The longer I delayed opening my mouth, the more she would squeeze. In later life, this training was to prove all too effective. My mouth popped open so readily that they had to to take away my ability to eat in order to undo it.</p>
<p>	If you walked straight ahead through the dining room, you entered a family room, which was a later addition after they'd lived there a few years. In the distance, facing the front door, was Grandma's Chair, so she could see who came in. There was a sofa and three or four other chairs. The television had been relocated in here, with Bob still supervising. This was where the Christmas tree was placed, with Martha, as the youngest sibling, sitting Indian-style on the floor and playing Santa. The dogs would have already sniffed out their presents. Now Martha would pass out the others after examination and predictions: "Bob's cigarettes. Bill's cigarettes. A book for Roger. Another book for Roger. From me to Jean. From Roger to Grandma..." </p>
<p><img src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/what-was-my-aunt-martha-trying-to-ask-me/_20martha_20and_202_20dogs-thumb-300x226-59019.jpg" width="300" height="226" alt=" martha and 2 dogs.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p>
<p>
Off the dining room to the right was the former living room. It connected on the left to Grandma's Room, which led to Martha's Room. And that was the house. I ask myself, where did Jean sleep? It had to be in the old living room, connected to Grandma's room. I cannot remember any bed ever being in that room. I don't know where Jean slept.</p>
<p>There was a big picture window overlooking the back yard, with its garage and a vegetable garden behind it, and a swing hanging from a tree branch. This tree was a climbing tree with a perch perfect for sitting in the leaves by the hour, often in study of the GOYA NUDE. </p>
<p>	One of the books I read circa 1950 was <i>Dianetics,</i> by L.Ron Hubbard. There were some family friends, the Mulligans, who lived not far away. Bob Mulligan worked for Uncle John at the Champaign Post Office. Their daughter, Betty Ann, was two years younger than me. I'd climb down from my tree limb we would sit in the swing and rock back and forth, while I recited large portions of lore from <i>Dianetics.</i> Engrams, E-Meters, getting Cleared. It didn't matter what we thought about it. The important thing is that we liked each other, and the act of me paying attention to her and she listening dutifully was a way to show our affection at that age. </p>
<p><i>Martha and her sister Annabel at Wapella</i></p>
<p><img src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/what-was-my-aunt-martha-trying-to-ask-me/martha_20and_20mom__20wapella-thumb-300x214-59015.jpg" width="300" height="214" alt="martha and mom, wapella.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p>
<p>	Sharing the back yard with us were Aunt Martha's dogs, always two, because they deserved someone to talk to. Sometimes I'd bring my Blackie along. Before I had Blackie, there was her Blackie, a fierce little Boston bull, whose existence centered on a red rubber ball. After I had savagely torn this from his mouth, he'd go into a frenzy until I threw it across the lawn. He'd tear across the lawn, kill it, and bring it back to me for another fight. He never figured out that if he only dropped it I would have thrown it again. He was completely prepared to take off one of my fingers to keep possession.</p>
<p>	It was Martha who gave me Ming, my lovable Pekinese, shortly after my father died in1960. This was one of the best things she could have done for my mother and me. My father's ban against house dogs (on the once-new Wall to Wall Carpeting) went to the grave with him, and we both doted on that dog. Martha never made a point of it, but I now realize she paid close attention to me, and understood and sympathized with me more than she tactfully choose to say. My home life was loving and happy, but not always restful; my mother was fearful and critical. When she remarried five years after Daddy's death, the reception was held in the Clark Street house. Martha quietly told me, "Good luck to George. Be nice to him. He's a good man." My father drank too much, Martha told me, and before I was born my mother got some medicine from the doctor and secretly gave it to him. It may have been an early form of Antabuse. "Wally had a few beers at the Elks Club," Martha told me, "and he couldn't move off the couch for two days." Daddy never drank again.</p>

<p>	Martha saw herself, I believe, as my backup mom to do things for me that were not in my mother's nature. My mother never voluntarily went to a movie in her life. Martha and Jean went constantly. They took me to what they would have seen anyway. <i>A Star is Born. I Want to Live. Going My Way. Stars in my Crown. I Was a Communist for the FBI. </i> At the Rialto in downtown Champaign, Hope and Crosby in their Road Movies. A different movie every week or two, and all three of us discussing them on the way home, the tires humming on the brick pavements. Daddy took me to <i>Hans Christian Anderson</i> with <a href="/cast-and-crew/danny-kaye">Danny Kaye</a>, <i>Bwana Devil</i> in 3D, and the first movie I ever saw, the Marx Brothers in <i>A Day at the Races. </i></p>
<p>	Martha was a culinary adventurer for those days. "We're having shrimp boiled in beer," she announced one night when we came over home. "Now I don't want anyone to worry. The alcohol all boils off." She bought huge quantities of unshelled shrimp at the Champaign Fish House, and we peeled them with our fingers and dipped in shrimp sauce or tartar sauce, sometimes alternately. They came with garlic bread, the kind wrapped in foil and bought frozen at the grocery. In summertime she invariably served Summer Salad from the garden: Sliced tomatoes, sliced cucumbers, sliced onion, a little oil, water, and sugar. Basil if there was some. All of my life I've made that salad that way, because that was how you made it.</p>
<p>	With her I tasted my first pizza. She picked me up and we drove out to the bowling alley at Five Points, which was attached to a "pizza-rea," she told me, which described a pizza pie the Italians ate. I have never tasted better pizza. Anise seed in the sausage. I already knew about Italian food in general, because of the drama with which we walked across the street to the Merlos to have spaghetti and meat balls. At Mr. Willis's house one night he ordered Chinese carry out, and when he told me we were having Egg Foo Yung I puked on my plate.</p>
<p>	Grandma died in 1960 and Martha and Jean bought a second place, a simple country cottage maybe 25 miles outside town, on the banks of stream. Here we would go on a Friday night to "camp out." Summer salad. Bill would fry chicken. Hamburgers and hot dogs on the Weber cooker. No TV. We would sit outside the cottage in folding chairs, engaging in the freedom of being in the country.</p>

Am I going on too much? I value these because they happened, and the sum of them is my lifetime. Grandma and Bob died, they sold the house, and Bill retired and bought a house with Martha and Jean in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. Martha was having heart problems, and Jean a good-paying job in a nearby hospital. Bill took on part time at a clothing store. I was in college by now. When mom and I would drive down to visit, there was always a visit to an auction, or they'd go "saleing" at garage sales. I was drinking too much in those days, and when we walked in the door Martha would un-pop a can of beer and hand it to me, no questions asked. Martha might have two beers, tops. Jean never seemed to drink. Bill occupied the kitchen, and invariably cooked a turkey at Thanksgiving and a capon at Christmas. He always prepared exactly the same menu: Orange jello with carrot slivers, served on iceberg lettuce with mayonnaise. Sweet potatoes. Mashed potatoes. Brussels sprouts. Green beans. Regular dressing Oyster dressing. For dessert, Aunt Margie's recipe: line dish with graham cracker crumbs, pour in mixture of...I dunno, but it tasted so good that I parceled it out one microscopic fork slice at a time.</p>
<p>	They moved away from Cape and in the 1970s and 1980s retired in house they bought in the small town of Wapella, Illinois. Bill took a sales job at a men's clothier in Clinton. They were one door down from the Catholic church, where Bill attended daily Mass, and they made a good friend of Fr. Dick Brunskill, the portly young man who would bury Martha and Bill. He was often at their house on holidays, a great admirer of Bill's ritualistic menu. The people next door and the people across the street were in and out of each other's houses all the time, not even knocking. Although that house had three bedrooms, Bill had Dave Sparrow build him a room taking up part of the garage, in keeping with a rule that Bill and Bob never slept under the same roof as Martha and Jean.</p>
<p>	Martha died on Thanksgiving. The house I bought in New Buffalo had a little cottage on the property, a big room that was kitchen, living area and a small bedroom. Martha announced she, Jean and Bill were moving in for the summer. She looked at me carefully. "Roger, we don't care what you do in your house. We may just never get another chance like this." The three of them constantly went sale-ing and to auction houses, never buying anything. They made great friends of Sophie and Nick Katsouris, who ran a greasy spoon at the stop light, and did light business in the evenings. Often Sophie would just prepare dinner and we'd all sit down together and eat, Nick getting up to carve gyros for a late customer.</p>
<p>Martha took the bedroom of the little "spare cottage." There was a sofa bed for Jean. Bill had Dave Sparrow make a bedroom in the attic for himself, its ceiling sloping low with a window at each end. In the evenings, they'd sit outdoors and just enjoy themselves until it was time to go into town for an ice cream cone at Oink's. Dave ordered the Oink's Challenge one night, a frisbee turned over and filled with ice cream and chocolate sauce, and polished it off.</p>

<p>	After Bill's last Thanksgiving meal, I was getting my Tarot deck read by my girlfriend Ingrid Magan Eng and didn't notice when Martha left. After awhile my friend McHugh came in and quietly told me, "Martha's not feeling so good." Did we drive her to the hospital in Michigan City, or was there an ambulance? That was where she tried so desperately hard to tell me something.</p>
<p>	The funeral was down in Wapella. The reception was in the Parish Hall, jammed with local people. Everyone in Wapella seemed to know and love Martha and Jean. She was buried on a gentle hillside in the cemetery outside town.</p>
<p>	The day before she died, Martha and I took a drive in to New Buffalo, because she wanted to have a talk. She said she wanted Bill and Jean to continue to share the house. After her death, Bill didn't want to, and moved into town, to a condo I never saw before the bad weekend when he had a couple of car crashes and had to move into Clark-Lindsay Retirement Home in Urbana, where Mary already lived in a little apartment she furnished herself. Jean moved up with her people around Chicago. I never saw her again. During our drive that day, Martha told me, "Take care of Jean."</p>]]>

    <title>The best bar in the world that I know about</title>

<p>The first Chicago bar I drank in was the Old Town Ale House. That bar was destroyed by fire in the 1960s, the customers hosed off, and the Ale House moved directly across the street to its present location, where it has been named Chicago's Best Dive Bar by the Chicago Tribune.
</p><p>I was taken to the Ale House by Tom Devries, my fellow college editor from the Roosevelt Torch. It was early on a snowy Sunday afternoon. I remember us walking down to Barbara's Bookstore to get our copies of the legendary New York Herald-Tribune Sunday edition. Pogo. Judith Crist. <a href="/cast-and-crew/tom-wolfe">Tom Wolfe</a>. <a href="/cast-and-crew/jimmy-breslin">Jimmy Breslin</a>. I remember peanut shells on the floor and a projector grinding through 16mm prints of <a href="/cast-and-crew/charlie-chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> shorts. I remember my first taste of dark Löwenbräu beer. The Ale House was cool even then.</p>
<p>I returned to the North Avenue drinking scene on New Year's Eve 1966, opening night of the legendary O'Rourke's, two blocks directly west. Its last call was 2 a.m. The Ale House had a 4 a.m. license, so many of us walked down the street to continue. O'Rourke's was the newspaper bar. The Ale House was the bohemian bar. Customers flowed freely between them.
</p><p><i>Tobin writes: "This is the painting of Arthur as a young sailor and Sandy Valentino, the most beautiful women he ever had sex with. She was a former Playboy Bunny and she was implicated in the famous kidnapping of the chimpanzee from Lincoln Park Zoo."</i><img src="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/assets_c/2013/02/bea%20ans%20art%3F-thumb-260x438-58603.jpeg" width="260" height="438" alt="bea ans art?.jpeg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"></p><p>
The bar was owned in recent years by Beatrice Klug and her ex-husband Art Klug, who really did look like <a href="/cast-and-crew/paul-newman">Paul Newman</a>. Art was a movie fan so obsessed it was slightly alarming. The Ale House ambiance made an ideal outpost for Bruce Elliott, the left wing unemployed-by-choice gadfly and social spy. Art died. Then Beatrice grew ill, and was catered to and cooed over daily by Bruce, his wife Tobin Mitchell, and their daughter Grace Littlefeather Elliott. </p><p>At the reading of her will it was revealed that Bea had <i>given </i> the bar to Tobin. Bruce could still preserve his proud record of never having worked a day in his life until his retirement at 65. (He did once, as a favor to a friend, drive a cab one Saturday morning during his San Francisco years, and has made a few bucks hustling golf for money on the public course in Jackson Park--a few times against Barack Obama, then a neighborhood organizer.)</p><p>Bea's gift inspired Bruce's blog, The Geriatric Genius, in which Elliott shows himself in the direct line of descent from the Host in the 15th century <i>The Canterbury Tales.</i> Chaucer's character is the central figure and narrator of the <i>Tales,</i> the one who knows all the others and is their common bond, yet rarely takes an active role during their pilgrimage. It is he who names them, convenes their nightly meetings, observes what they do, hears their secrets, and tells of their weaknesses. </p><p><img src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/the-best-bar-in-the-world-that-i-know-about/host-thumb-350x211-58606.jpg" width="350" height="211" alt="host.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"><b><i></i></b></p><p>And briefly, when the sun had gone to rest,
So had I spoken with them, every one,
That I was of their fellowship anon,
And made agreement that we'd early rise
To take the road, as you I will apprise.
But none the less, whilst I have time and space,
Before yet farther in this tale I pace,
It seems to me accordant with reason
To inform you of the state of every one
Of all of these, as it appeared to me,
And who they were, and what was their degree,
And even how arrayed there at the inn.</p>]]>
