<p><em><strong>Rebel without a Cause</strong> (1955).</em></p>
<p>KT here:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for our annual scan of the past year&#8217;s entries, pointing particularly to ones that might be useful to teachers and students using <em>Film Art: An Introduction</em>. For occasional readers of the blog, this post might be useful in catching up on items you might have missed.</p>
<p>This year we&#8217;ve added four video essays and lectures to our site. These have entailed a lot of effort, but David has enjoyed making them as free complements to <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/03/16/film-art-an-introduction-reaches-a-milestone-with-help-from-the-criterion-collection/" target="_blank">the briefer, walled-garden video essays</a> accompanying our latest edition of <em>Film Art</em>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also delighted to include some entries based around encounters we have had with filmmakers (some of whom we met as a result of our blog) and two contributions from guest experts. Looking back, we are as usual surprised at how much material has accumulated in one year. The summer&#8217;s new movies may on the whole have disappointed, but obviously there are a lot of other interesting topics to explore outside the multiplex.</p>
<p>For earlier blog-roundups, see <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2007/09/06/is-there-a-blog-in-this-class/" target="_blank">2007</a>, <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2008/09/06/is-there-a-blog-in-this-class-2008/" target="_blank">2008</a>, <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2009/09/22/is-there-a-blog-in-this-class-2009/" target="_blank">2009</a>, <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2010/09/02/is-there-a-blog-in-this-class-2010/" target="_blank">2010</a>, <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2011/08/22/is-there-a-blog-in-this-class-2011/" target="_blank">2011</a>, and <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/08/13/is-there-a-blog-in-this-class-2012/" target="_blank">2012</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll go through <em>Film Art</em> chapter by chapter, suggesting relevant entries for each, and end with a couple of entries on new DVDs that teachers might want to add to their personal or departmental libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 1 Film Art and Filmmaking<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Last year, David&#8217;s <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/category/pandoras-digital-box-the-blog-series/" target="_blank">&#8220;Pandora&#8217;s Digital Box&#8221; series</a> dealt with the transition from film-based to digital-based production and distribution. (That series was revised and expanded into <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/books/pandora.php" target="_blank">a book</a>.) The original series is updated in <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/05/12/pandoras-digital-box-end-times/" target="_blank">&#8220;Pandora&#8217;s Digital Box: End times.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>This year, David looked back on some historical formats. In <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/09/26/the-wayward-charms-of-cinerama/" target="_blank">&#8220;The wayward charms of Cinerama,&#8221;</a> he reviewed Flicker Alley&#8217;s DVD release of <em>This is Cinerama</em> and took the occasion to analyze the peculiar perspective relations created by the triple-camera system. <em>How the West Was Won</em> and <em>The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm</em> receive some stylistic scrutiny.</p>
<p>Super 16mm is still a significant gauge for independent filmmaking, but regular 16mm as has largely been replaced by DVD and Blu-ray for classroom and film-buff viewing. David waxes nostalgic concerning the charms of 16mm and its importance in our own film-watching careers in <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/03/04/sweet-16/" target="_blank">&#8220;Sweet 16&#8243;</a> and <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/03/11/16-still-super/" target="_blank">&#8220;16, still super.&#8221;</a> For those too young to have seen 16mm on a screen, these recollections might make it a bit more vivid.</p>
<p>Nothing conveys the tangible work of film production like a visit to a working set. Our colleague James Udden, expert on Taiwanese cinema, had an opportunity to watch a major contemporary director in action and reports for us in <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/01/06/master-shots-on-the-set-of-hou-hsiao-hsiens-the-assassin/" target="_blank">&#8220;Master shots: On the set of Hou Hsiaeo-hsien&#8217;s THE ASSASSIN.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Publicity is a big part of the distribution of a modern blockbuster. In <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/05/07/jack-and-the-bean-counters/" target="_blank">&#8220;Jack and the Bean-counters,&#8221; </a>I examine the missteps in the campaign for <em>Jack the Giant-Slayer</em> and talk about how the studios avoid cooperating with fans eager to provide valuable free online publicity for their favorite films.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 3 Narrative Form<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Films often use repetition in an obvious way to help us easily follow a story. But what about filmmakers who introduce more subtle similarities that challenge our memories? We examine two such films made in South Korea, <em>In Another Country</em> and <em>Romance Joe</em>, in <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/10/04/memories-are-unmade-by-this/" target="_blank">&#8220;Memories are unmade by this.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Repetition is also central to <em>Mildred Pierce</em>, where a murder that happens at the beginning of the film is seen again, with different shots and timings, near the end. We look at how the film fools us without our noticing it. The sequences are here:</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/68895551" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/06/26/twice-told-tales-mildred-pierce/" target="_blank">&#8220;Twice-told tales: MILDRED PIERCE&#8221; </a>analyzes the different functions and effects of the two sequences.</p>
<p>Art films and classics are not the only films with intriguing storytelling. <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/09/03/clocked-doing-50-in-the-dead-zone/" target="_blank">&#8220;Clocked doing 50 in the Dead Zone&#8221;</a> is an analysis of David Koepp&#8217;s <em>Premium Rush</em> as a short film that packs a lot of action and clever narrative tactics into its running time. That entry led to a meeting with Koepp and a follow-up entry on his approach as screenwriter and director. See the Chapter 8 section.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5 The Shot: Cinematography</strong></p>
<p>Seeing some recent Asian films at the 2012 Vancouver International Film Festival led to <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/10/07/stretching-the-shot/" target="_blank">&#8220;Stretching the shot,&#8221;</a> some thoughts on functions for the long take.</p>
<p>A lot of the films we see in theaters today are made in anamorphic widescreen processes, and by now letterboxing for home-video is familiar to all. David has often lectured on the history and aesthetics of the first successful anamorphic process, CinemaScope. Now that PowerPoint lecture is available on his Vimeo site. See<a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/04/24/scoping-things-out-a-new-video-lecture/" target="_blank"> &#8220;Scoping things out: A new video lecture&#8221;</a> for an introduction and link. (It&#8217;s about 53 minutes long, so perhaps something to assign your students to watch on their own.)</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/64644113" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 6 The Relation of Shot to shot: Editing</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/10/28/news-a-video-essay-on-constructive-editing/" target="_blank">&#8220;News! A video essay on constructive editing&#8221;</a> introduces the additionof an analysis of editing in Robert Bresson&#8217;s <em>Pickpocket</em> to Vimeo.  It&#8217;s about 12 minutes long, suitable for classroom use or assignment for students to watch outside of class. Our thanks to our friends at the <a href="http://www.criterion.com/" target="_blank">Criterion Collection</a> for their permission to use the excerpts from <em>Pickpocket.</em></p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/52312154" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>How much can a single cut reveal about the power of editing? <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/01/22/sometimes-two-shots/" target="_blank">&#8220;Sometimes two shots &#8230;&#8221;</a> takes a close look at a brief passage from August Blom&#8217;s <em>The Mormon&#8217;s Victim,</em> a 1911 Danish one-reel film and finds a lot going on in it.</p>
<p>Some students might have trouble recognizing jump cuts.<a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/06/03/sometimes-a-jump-cut/" target="_blank"> &#8220;Sometimes a jump cut &#8230;&#8221;</a> looks at some examples from the martial-arts action scenes from two of King Hu&#8217;s masterpieces, <em>A Touch of Zen</em> and <em>Dragon Gate Inn</em>. These are quite different in look and function from the <em>Breathless</em> examples given in <em>Film Art</em>&#8211;and you can clearly see the splices.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 7 Sound in the Cinema</strong></p>
<p>Faced with innovations in sound technology, we turned to our friend and colleague Jeff Smith. His <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/05/01/atmos-all-around-a-guest-post-by-jeff-smith/" target="_blank">&#8220;Atmos all around&#8221;</a> is an excellent introduction to the new system. Unlike most surveys of technology, his piece analyzes in considerable detail how artists use it&#8211;here, in Pixar&#8217;s <em>Brave</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 8 Summary: Style and Film Form</strong></p>
<p>Alfred Hitchcock is undoubtedly one of the most frequently taught filmmakers, since his work is not only stylistically elegant, but it&#8217;s easy for students to pick up on. One reason for this is that he is fond of flashy set pieces, scenes that are skillfully composed to be the high points of a film. We examine his skill in this regard in <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/02/14/sir-alfred-simply-must-have-his-set-pieces-the-man-who-knew-too-much-1934/" target="_blank">&#8220;Sir Alfred simply must have his set pieces: THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, Hitchcock is equally good at subtle touches. Some might consider his 3-D film, <em>Dial M for Murder</em>, to be a bit theatrical, since much of its action is confined to a single set. Yet as we argue in <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/09/07/dial-m-for-murder-hitchcock-frets-not-at-his-narrow-room/" target="_blank">&#8220;DIAL M FOR MURDER: Hitchcock frets not at his narrow room,&#8221; </a>the director finds many small, creative ways to frame and edit his shots in ways that are purely cinematic.</p>
<p>As we emphasize in <em>Film Art</em>, filmmaking is based on a huge number of creative decisions. During this past year, encounters with two practitioners gave us a chance to learn how they went about making some of these choices. Tim Hunter, director of <em>River&#8217;s Edge</em> (1987) and numerous episodes of television series like <em>Twin Peaks</em> and <em>Breaking Bad</em>, visited Madison. <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/11/25/auteurist-on-the-sound-stage/" target="_blank">&#8220;Auteurist on the sound stage&#8221; </a>discusses how Hunter plans ahead where he will place his camera, since the fast pace of television production allows little time for such decisions on the set. He also talks about tailoring his style to that of the specific television series he is working on.</p>
<p>In June David visited screenwriter and director David Koepp in his New York office. Koepp is best known for his work with Steven Spielberg, including the scripts for <em>Jurassic Park</em> and <em>War of the Worlds</em>, but he has also directed films. <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/06/18/david-koepp-making-the-world-movie-sized/" target="_blank">&#8220;David Koepp: Making the world movie-sized&#8221; </a>discusses how Koepp finds the &#8220;Gizmo,&#8221; or basic premise, for big blockbusters and how he compresses the plots of best-sellers for the screen. He also talks about narrowing down the many choices available to a filmmaker, creating constraints that will allow him to find the best choices for a given situation&#8211;with camera placement again being a basic consideration.</p>
<p>This past year two major contemporary directors died: Tony Scott, director of flashy, violent Hollywood action films, and Theo Angelopoulos, maker of austere, stately dramas about Greek history and politics. We find some surprising stylistic parallels between their work, despite their obvious differences, in <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/02/03/tony-and-theo/" target="_blank">&#8220;Tony and Theo.&#8221;</a></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 9 Film Genres</strong></p>
<p>Since <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> appeared in 1999, there has developed a sub-genre of horror films masquerading as found-footage documentaries. <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/11/13/return-to-paranormalcy/" target="_blank">&#8220;Return to Paranormalcy&#8221;</a> focuses on the successful series of films that began in 2007 with <em>Paranormal Activity</em> and explores how each successive film has managed to vary the point-of-view conventions in order to maintain audience interest.</p>
<p>This chapter of <em>Film Art</em> contains a &#8220;Closer Look&#8221; box examining &#8220;Creative Decisions in a Contemporary Genre: The Crime Thriller as Subgenre.&#8221; Our entry <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/03/24/side-effects-and-safe-haven-out-of-the-past/" target="_blank">&#8220;SIDE EFFECTS and SAFE HAVEN: Out of the past&#8221;</a> looks at two more recent examples of this genre, focusing on how their conventions revive and vary conventions that had been introduced in 1940s Hollywood films in this same genre. Here&#8217;s a good example of genre conventions coming and going in cycles.</p>
<p>For most people, the name &#8220;Kurosawa&#8221; conjures up only the venerated Akira Kurosawa, director of classics like <em>Seven Samurai</em> and <em>Red Beard</em>. But there is a younger Kurosawa, Kiyoshi, a contemporary filmmaker. While in Brussels in July, David had a chance to attend a screening of his<em> Shokuzai</em>. In <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/07/21/the-other-kurosawa-shokuzai/" target="_blank">&#8220;The other Kurosawa: SHOKUZAI,&#8221;</a> David puts Kiyoshi Kurosawa in his historical context and analyzes the film as a combination horror film and crime thriller, as well as including some stylistic analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 10 Documentary, Experimental, and Animated Films</strong></p>
<p>Shirley Clarke was a major director of experimental and documentary films. <em>Portrait of Jason,</em> her feature-length recording of the recollections and comments of a gay black man was re-released in a restored version last year. <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/03/17/ill-never-tell-jason-reborn/" target="_blank">&#8220;I&#8217;ll never tell: JASON reborn&#8221;</a> discusses its avant-garde approach to recording its subject&#8217;s account of what may or may not be the truth. The entry also details the restoration process, which involved material Clarke deposited at the University of Wisconsin-Madison&#8217;s archive, <a href="http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/wcftr/film.asp" target="_blank">the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research.</a></p>
<p>Of the five animated features from 2012 nominated for Oscars this year, three were made using the traditional stop-motion technique with puppets: <em>Frankenweenie, The Pirates! Band of Misfits,</em> and <em>Paranorman</em>. <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/02/08/annies-to-oscars-this-years-animated-features/" target="_blank">&#8220;Annies to Oscars: this year&#8217;s animated features&#8221;</a> discusses them, as well as the computer-generated features, <em>Brave</em> and <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 11 Critical Analysis of Films</strong></p>
<p>During the past year we&#8217;ve written quite a lot about film analysis. These entries might give some encouragement and suggestions to students embarking on their own critical studies of films.</p>
<p>In June the new online film journal, <a href="http://www.thecine-files.com/" target="_blank">The Cine-Files</a>, interviewed Kristin about her approach to film analysis. The editors kindly allowed us to post the interview, <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/06/12/good-old-fashioned-love-i-e-close-analysis-of-film/" target="_blank">&#8220;Good, old-fashioned love (i.e., close analysis&#8221; of film&#8221; </a>on our site as well. The interview includes discussions as such topics as, &#8220;Please tell us about something that couldn’t be understood without a frame-by-frame attention to detail.&#8221; It also discusses our recent forays into online video and PowerPoint analysis.</p>
<p>A lot of interpretation of films gets done, by professional critics and students, by fans, and by anyone who gets an idea about a film and offers it to the world. In <em>Film Art</em>, we suggest that valid interpretations of films tend to be based on close analysis of all aspects of the film. Needless to say, not every interpreter does the work of analysis before expounding their ideas. The feature documentary about amateur interpretations of Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s <em>The Shining</em> gave us an opportunity to discuss this tendency in <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/04/07/all-play-and-no-work-room-237/" target="_blank">&#8220;All play and no work? ROOM 237.&#8221;</a> Surprisingly, some ideas offered by the subjects of the documentary aren&#8217;t necessarily that different from those propounded by professionals.</p>
<p>Christopher Nolan is one of the most admired filmmakers in contemporary Hollywood. What sets him apart? We discuss some of his innovatory tactics in <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/08/19/nolan-vs-nolan/" target="_blank">&#8220;Nolan vs. Nolan.&#8221;</a> The focus is on <em>Insomnia</em>, but with mentions of<em> Magic Mike, Memento, Inception,</em> and <em>The Prestige</em>. The latter is our primary example in <em>Film Art</em>&#8216;s chapter on sound, and this entry might offer useful background material for teachers who show <em>The Prestige</em> to their classes.</p>
<p>For many students, non-Hollywood films can be intimidating to watch and even more so to analyze. <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/08/26/how-to-watch-an-art-movie-reel-1/" target="_blank">&#8220;How to watch an art movie, reel 1&#8243;</a> offers hints for understanding and discussing art films. The film in question is Jaime Rosales’ Spanish film <em>Sueño y silencio </em>(2013). It hasn&#8217;t been widely seen, but one need not have seen the film to understand the analysis of its first twenty minutes. This entry discusses conventions of the art film that might help students in writing their own essays.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 12 Historical Changes in Film Art: Conventions and Choices, Tradition and Trends</strong></p>
<p>One section of this chapter deals with &#8220;The Development of the Classical Hollywood Cinema (1908-1927).&#8221; In another new video lecture, &#8220;How Motion Pictures Became the Movies 1908-1920,&#8221;  we deal with the same period on an international level. The lecture traces many of the basic techniques of cinematic storytelling in use in modern cinema back to their origins in this crucial early period. For an introduction to the video, see  <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/01/12/what-next-a-video-lecture-i-suppose-well-actually-yeah/" target="_blank">&#8220;What next? A video lecture, I suppose. Well, actually, yeah &#8230;&#8221;</a></p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/57245550" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Of the three major European stylistic movements of the 1920s discussed in Chapter 12, French Impressionism, German Expressionism, and Soviet Montage, Impressionism has traditionally been the most difficult to teach, due largely to a scarcity of prints of films from the movement. Now a group of major Impressionist films have become available on DVD, those made by the Soviet-emigré Albatros production company. In <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/05/21/albatros-soars/" target="_blank">&#8220;Albatros soars,&#8221;</a> we describe the films and their release in a prize-winning box set from Flicker Alley. We think students would find <em>La brasier ardent</em> intriguing, if puzzling.</p>
<p>David is at work on a book on 1940s Hollywood cinema. Left-over ideas from that project end up as blog entries now and then. These could fit in with the section, &#8220;The Classical Hollywood Cinema after the Coming of Sound, 1930s -1940s.&#8221; One such entry, <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/12/17/a-dose-of-dos-trade-secrets-from-selznick/" target="_blank">&#8220;A dose of DOS: Trade secrets from Selznick,&#8221;</a> looks at the hands-on approach of David O. Selznick, arguably the most important independent producer of the era. His guidance affected the style of <em>Gone with the Wind, </em><em>Rebecca, Spellbound,</em> <em>Duel in the Sun, </em>and other classics of the Hollywood system. <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/05/27/on-the-more-or-less-plausible-sneakiness-of-one-preston-sturges/" target="_blank">Another entry</a> considers in-jokes planted in 1940s films.</p>
<p>David has also posted a related essay in the main section of his website, <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/essays/murder.php" target="_blank">&#8220;Murder Culture: Adventures in 1940s Suspense,&#8221; </a>dealing with the influence of mystery and detective fiction on films of the 1940s. For an introduction and link to this essay and to several other blog entries on filmmaking of the decade, see <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/03/28/the-1940s-mon-amour/" target="_blank">&#8220;The 1940s, mon amour.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>The final section of Chapter 12 deals with &#8220;Hong Kong Cinema, 1980s-1990s.&#8221; The recent death of Lau Kar-leung, one of the major martial-arts choreographers and directors of the 1970s and 1980s, led us to post an appreciation of his style and films in <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/07/02/lion-dancing-lau-kar-leung/" target="_blank">&#8220;Lion, dancing: Lau Kar-leung.&#8221; </a>The final section provides many bibliographical sources and other information on Hong Kong cinema, as well as links to earlier entries on the subject.</p>
<p>Johnnie To is one of the few directors still successfully maintaining the tradition of Hong Kong action films. The latest of our entries on him deals with a recent release: <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/07/08/mixing-business-with-pleasure-johnnie-tos-drug-war/" target="_blank">&#8220;Mixing business with pleasure: Johnnie To&#8217;s DRUG WAR.&#8221;</a></p>
<p><strong>DVDs to consider</strong></p>
<p>At intervals we post round-ups of recent DVD and Blu-ray releases. The titles usually aren&#8217;t the big, recent, popular films, but more specialized items put out by companies like Flicker Alley, Eureka!, and Kino that specialize in issuing classic films, often in beautifully restored versions. A lot of these films have never been available on home video before, and they open up new possibilities for teachers who want to broaden their students&#8217; viewing experiences. They&#8217;re also titles to recommend to those enthusiastic students who want recommendations for films they can view on their own.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/11/29/classics-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-in-time-for-a-froliche-weinacht/" target="_blank">&#8220;Classics on DVD and Blu-ray, for a fröliche Weihnachten!&#8221;</a> deals mostly with German silent films, including a set of four starring the early superstar Asta Nielsen, and two films by G. W. Pabst: the first release of his debut film, an Expressionist-style work called<em> Der Schatz</em>, and the most complete restoration so far available of <em>The Joyless Street</em>. A new and longer version of Ernst Lubitsch&#8217;s <em>Das Weib des Pharao</em> is included, as is a charming Technicolor version of Gilbert and Sullivan&#8217;s <em>The Mikado</em> from 1939.</p>
<p>Regular readers are familiar with our annual tradition of naming the ten-best films of the current year but of 90 years ago. For once all the films on our list of <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/12/31/the-ten-best-films-of-1922/" target="_blank">&#8220;The ten best films of &#8230; 1922&#8243;</a> are all available on DVD, including a stunning print of Fritz Lang&#8217;s <em>Dr. Mabuse der Spieler</em> and the Criterion Collection&#8217;s release of the Svenska Filminstitutet&#8217;s restoration of Benjamin Christensen&#8217;s <em>Häxan</em> (better known in the USA as <em>Witchcraft through the Ages</em>).</p>

<p><em>Home page of <a href="http://lantern.mediahist.org/" target="_blank">Lantern</a> (top half).</em></p>
<p>DB here:</p>
<p>In earlier entries (<a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2011/10/17/catching-up-99/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/06/23/industrial-strength/" target="_blank">here</a>) we&#8217;ve reminded you of the immense and growing resource that is the <strong><a href="http://mediahistoryproject.org/" target="_blank">Media History Digital Library</a></strong>. It was founded and is directed by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-pierce/10/4a6/95" target="_blank">David Pierce</a>, world-renowned moving-image archivist, and it&#8217;s co-directed by UW-Madison Communication Arts professor <a href="http://erichoyt.org/about" target="_blank">Eric Hoyt</a>. If you haven&#8217;t wandered, or rushed, or hop-skipped, through this wondrous library devoted to images and sounds, you owe it to yourself to start.</p>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s a remarkable resource for historians of film, television, and radio. It gathers a huge number of periodicals that can be searched, read, and downloaded&#8211;gratis. Thanks to its hookup with the Internet Archive, you can access and own entire books. The tireless Catherine Grant gives us <a href="http://filmstudiesforfree.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Film Studies for Free</a>. David and Eric give us Film History for Free.</p>
<p>But it isn&#8217;t just professional and amateur researchers who benefit. Anyone even mildly curious about media in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries should take the time to browse through the fan&#8217;s paradise that is <a href="http://mediahistoryproject.org/fanmagazines/" target="_blank"><em>Photoplay</em></a>, the show-biz churn of <a href="http://mediahistoryproject.org/hollywood/" target="_blank"><em>Variety</em></a>, the <a href="http://mediahistoryproject.org/technical/" target="_blank">techie wonderland</a> that is <em>Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers</em> and <em>International Projectionist</em> and many other publications. I guarantee you will be surprised and delighted by what you find: Big pages, beautifully displayed, that can hold you, we might say, <a href="http://archive.org/stream/photoplay118phot#page/n479/mode/2up" target="_blank">spellbound</a>; or at least make you <a href="http://archive.org/stream/photoplay118phot#page/n471/mode/2up" target="_blank">girl crazy. </a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Bergman-400.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24158" title="Bergman 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Bergman-400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="577" /></a>     <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mickey-400.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-24159 alignnone" title="Mickey 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mickey-400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="577" /></a></p>
<p>Why have you held back? Perhaps the sheer number of collections was daunting. And previously you had to search each journal separately, year by year.</p>
<p>Now <a href="http://lantern.mediahist.org/credits/index" target="_blank">Eric and his team</a>, many here at UW, have made things even easier for historians and civilians alike. Today the MHDL crew have unveiled their new super-search engine, <strong><a href="http://lantern.mediahist.org/" target="_blank">Lantern</a></strong>. Lantern allows you to search <em>all</em> of the MHDL publications at one go. Apart from the massive efficiency, you discover sources you wouldn&#8217;t have thought to check.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re bold and type in <em>Chaplin</em>, for instance, you get 1446 hits. Many of them are from books, thanks to the generosity of <strong>Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum, Jeff Joseph</strong>, and many contributors to <a href="http://archive.org/index.php" target="_blank"><strong>the Internet Archive</strong></a>. I struck minor gold with my first hit, a page from Charlie&#8217;s 1922 travel memoir <em>My Visit</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Dear Mr. Chaplin: You are a leader in your line and I am a leader in mine. Your specialty is moving pictures and custard pies. My specialty is windmills. I know more about windmills than any man in the world. . . . You have only to furnish the money. I have the brains, and in a few years I will make you rich and famous.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Welles-Toland-250.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-24161 alignright" title="Welles-Toland 250" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Welles-Toland-250.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="190" /></a>A search for <em>Gregg Toland</em> brings you not only his much-reprinted 1941 <em>American Cinematographer</em> article, <a href="http://archive.org/stream/american22asch#page/n59/mode/2up/search/kane" target="_blank">&#8220;Realism for Citizen Kane,&#8221; </a>but also many <em>AC</em> articles featuring professional discussion of his contributions&#8211;not all of them complimentary. &#8220;Pan-focus&#8230;,&#8221; notes one, &#8220;may be a flash in the pan.&#8221; <a href="http://archive.org/stream/american22asch#page/n429/mode/2up/search/foxes" target="_blank">An anonymous review</a> of <em>The Little Foxes </em>complains that in some shots &#8220;The eye hardly knows where to look.&#8221; But go beyond <em>AC</em> and you find lesser-known treasures: articles by <em>Kane&#8217;</em>s <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/internationalpho13holl#page/n11/mode/2up/search/toland" target="_blank"> on-set still photographer</a>, <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/internationalpho13holl#page/n71/mode/2up/search/toland" target="_blank">a different piece</a> by Toland (opposite a full-page topless young lady), and 52 more. That&#8217;s just in 1941.</p>
<p>Yes, while the default search digs for everything, you can limit your search by year and along other parameters.</p>
<p>Lest you think that this bounty is of interest only for followers of Hollywood, please note that<a href="http://mediahistoryproject.org/globalcinema/" target="_blank"> the Global Cinema collection (1904-1957)</a> includes books and periodicals from France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain, and the United Kingdom. In 1921, for instance, Louis Delluc&#8217;s magazine <em>Cinéa, </em>while badmouthing <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2010/11/11/how-to-watch-fantomas-and-why/" target="_blank">Feuillade</a> fairly constantly, gives unflagging support to<a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2011/12/29/the-ten-best-films-of-1921/" target="_blank"> L&#8217;Herbier&#8217;s <em>El Dorado</em></a> and adds in <a href="http://archive.org/stream/cina21pari#page/n295/mode/2up/search/DORADO" target="_blank">this sprightly caricature</a> of Eve Francis.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/El-Dorado-300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24170" title="El Dorado 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/El-Dorado-300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="402" /></a></p>
<p>Not all the collections are complete. There are of course copyright constraints on recent publications, and some journals are so rare that the runs must be filled in as copies are found. But the MHDL, like the universe, is constantly expanding, and possibly faster. Soon to be added are <em>Quigley&#8217;s Exhibitors Herald</em>, <em>Cine-mundial</em>, and more years of <em>Variety</em>. This spectacular enterprise is in the hands of people who are utter and dedicated completists.</p>
<p>I hate to pull a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2C_xUlcv2k" target="_blank">Grandpa Simpson</a>, but when I think of all the time and money and gasoline and air tickets I ran through over several decades to visit libraries holding a few issues of this or that journal . . . and then think about the hours I spent paging through them looking for certain names, terms, film titles . . . and then think about how I painstakingly copied what I wanted onto 3 x 5 cards (photocopy not permitted) . . . I think&#8211;Well, what do you <em>think</em> I think?! I think how damn lucky you (and I) are to have all this material so accessible now. For work <em>and</em> play.</p>
<p>Same thing, come to think of it.</p>

<p>World War II never goes away, as the current attention given to Hollywood’s relation to Nazi Germany indicates. Thomas Doherty’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hollywood-Hitler-1933-1939-Culture-Series/dp/0231163924" target="_blank">Hollywood and Hitler</a> and Ben Urwand&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Collaboration-Hollywoods-Pact-Hitler/dp/0674724747/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375917724&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+collaboration+hollywood%27s+pact+with+hitler" target="_blank">The Collaboration: Hollywood&#8217;s Pact with Hitler</a> trace how the American studios responded to the rise of Nazism and the launching of hostilities. While working on 1940s Hollywood, I ran across two films that deal with another member of the Axis. They remind us of some painful incidents in our history, and they show how inflamed patriotism can burst into racial panic and oppressive public policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Call it a mass migration</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Headline-4001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24114" title="Headline 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Headline-4001.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="297" /></a></p>
<p>Soon after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in December 1941, there arose a fear that saboteurs were at work in America. No solid evidence of this was demonstrated, but the most powerful decision-makers were not in a mood to be tentative. In February 1942, President Roosevelt signed an executive order that authorized the Secretary of War and military commanders to demarcate areas from which anyone could be excluded. The Pacific coast was declared such a zone.</p>
<p>In early 1942, the US Army rounded up 110,000 California residents of Japanese ancestry and sent them to what were called concentration camps. (At that point the term simply meant a camp in which enemy populations were &#8220;concentrated.&#8221;) The evacuees were dispersed to makeshift camps throughout California, as well as in Wyoming, Arizona, Oregon, and Washington state.</p>
<p>Some of the internees were first-generation immigrants, but about 90,000, were citizens. A 1942 government documentary film presents the &#8220;relocation&#8221; process as necessary for national security, and it shows the evacuees accepting, in a spirit of patriotic submission, the need for such measures. In the film the evacuees effortlessly re-create their communities in their new locations.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="375" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/5_rk3RP5KQs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Bizarre as it sounds today, the film takes pride in showing that a democracy can create humane concentration camps. But a reading of Richard Lingeman’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-You-Know-Theres-War/dp/1560254653/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375917866&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=don%27t+you+know+there%27s+a+war+on" target="_blank"><em>Don’t You Know There’s a War On?</em> </a>points up some things the film doesn’t say. The film doesn’t mention that the people rounded up were forced to abandon their homes, businesses, and farms and were permitted to take only what they could carry. (Newspapers often described the relocation as &#8220;voluntary.&#8221;) The film doesn’t show that the relocation centers were jerry-built, some by the inmates themselves, and were often located in harsh climates. The camp at Heart Mountain, Wyoming, was subject to sandstorms, blizzards, and subzero temperatures. Nor does the documentary mpte that the camps were enclosed in barbed wire and watched over by armed guards in security towers. Nor does the documentary show that, because Japanese-American farms produced 40 percent of the California vegetable crop, rival growers pressed for the internment and then snapped up the displaced farmers’ lands at what Lingeman calls “eviction–sale prices.”</p>
<p>The Japanese weren&#8217;t unique in undergoing internment; other ethnic groups were subject to investigation, confinement, and relocation. But no other minority was subjected to such a comprehensive roundup. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_American_internment" target="_blank">It&#8217;s estimated</a>, for example, that about 11,000 German-Americans, innocent or suspected, were interned&#8211;a significant violation of their rights, but nothing on the scale of Japanese internment. White people of European extraction, German-Americans had become pillars of American society, and were very numerous. (They were and remain the largest U. S. minority self-identified by descent.) Japanese-Americans, a much tinier and more vulnerable minority, were more easily marked as potentially alien to American values.</p>
<p>Late in 1942, the government began resettling Japanese-American internees outside the camps, spreading them to several states. In December of 1944,  partly as a result of <a href="http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Ex_parte_Endo/" target="_blank">a Supreme Court decision</a>  the government could not consign &#8220;concededly loyal&#8221; citizens to camps,  authorities declared that the west coast was no longer a war zone. But fears of Japanese espionage didn’t subside, as we can see from a 1945 independent film called <em>Samurai</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pledged to the God of War</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SAMURAI-swords.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24103" title="SAMURAI swords" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SAMURAI-swords.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><em>Samurai</em> shows an adopted Japanese boy growing into a traitor and spy. In September 1923, Mr. and Mrs. Morrey rescue Kenkichi from the ruins of the Tokyo earthquake and bring him home to San Francisco. While attending school and assimilating into American society, Kenkichi secretly visits a Buddhist temple where the priest inculcates him in the martial tradition of Bushido, the way of the samurai. Studying to be a doctor, Kenkichi becomes a proficient painter. At the same time, he swears to live and die by the sword, repeating the priest’s pledge that “The God of War presents the key to eternal life!”</p>
<p>The unsuspecting Morreys send Kenkichi to Italy and Germany for his studies, and the priest exhorts him make contacts that will train him as a secret agent. Back in America he begins painting abstract landscapes that conceal military information in coded form&#8211;a strange version of that motif of  paintings and portraits that winds through 1940s American cinema (<em>The Two Mrs. Carrolls, Suspicion, The Ministry of Fear</em>). When the painting is abstract and nonrepresentational, it usually suggests that the painter may be mad.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Painting-300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24109" title="Painting 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Painting-300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Telling his parents that he will be a curator of Asian art, Ken goes to Tokyo and there, at the Black Dragon Society, he decodes his paintings. The Dragon Society’s leader suspects that his visitor is an American spy, but the doubts are dispelled when Kenkichi alters photos from Shanghai to appear that the Japanese are aiding the Chinese. Ken further proves his loyalty by murdering a journalist. He is assigned to the unit of General Sujiyama as a full-fledged spy.</p>
<p>Back at home, Kenkichi tells his priest of his mission, and shows what his reward will be: When the Japanese take over the west coast, he will become governor of California. Explosives are smuggled in, and Japanese farmers (“another link in the chain,” the voice-over narrator tells us) are coordinating domestic spies and saboteurs. The Morreys’ younger son Frank discovers Ken’s plot and tips off the police, while Kenkichi tries to convince the parents that he’s a double agent—before stabbing his father to death. Meanwhile, the invasion has been synchronized with the Pearl Harbor attack. At the climax, the temple priest realizes that his spy network has been arrested and his plan has failed. He commits ritual suicide, but Kenkichi, after brandishing the long samurai sword boldly, doesn’t follow the warrior’s way and instead flees to the beach. There he&#8217;s shot down by the police.</p>
<p>Premiered in New York in August 1945, after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, <em>Samurai </em>seems to have gotten a very limited release. It’s a cheap production, filled out with montages of newsreel footage, feeble special effects (the back-projection of the Kanto earthquake is especially jarring), and minimalist studio sets. Chinese actors, some with prior Hollywood experience, played the Japanese characters. The device of Kenkichi&#8217;s coded paintings seems to be borrowed from <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~eo9066/1942/ROJA/Report_on_Japanese_Activities_1942.html#SECTION_IV" target="_blank">illustrative examples of espionage techniques</a> filed as evidence in <a href="http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Dies%20Committee/" target="_blank">the 1942-1943 Dies Committee investigation</a>. The We-want-your-white-women motif is made salient in a scene in which Ken and General Sujiyama disport with women captives. Ken toys with a blonde before tripping her.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ken-and-woman-300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24104" title="Ken and woman 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ken-and-woman-300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>During the same scene, a Chinese woman fights off the General’s advances before tearing up the Japanese flag. As was typical of the period, the Chinese were presented as courageous and defiant in the face of the Japanese invasion.</p>
<p><em>Samurai</em> was planned in 1943 under the title  “Confessions of a Japanese Spy,” an echo of Warners’ <em>Confessions of a Nazi Spy</em> of 1940. According to <a href="http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=27753" target="_blank">the AFI entry</a>, another working title was <em>Orders from Tokyo</em>. Producer Ben Mindenburg supplied the story, and the director Raymond Cannon (who worked intermittently at Fox, Monogram, and elsewhere) is credited with the screenplay. Scenes suggesting rape of the General&#8217;s captive women displeased the Production Code Administration. The picture was awarded a PCA seal eventually, so perhaps some portions were omitted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>110,000 people inconvenienced</strong></p>
<p>As a minor independent production with small circulation, <em>Samurai</em> can be dismissed as an outlier. It apparently wasn’t reviewed in <em>Variety</em>, but the <em>New York Times</em> called it “an example of opportunistic filmmaking . . . lurid and sensational. At this late hour, a motion picture should do something more than just shout, ‘The Japanese are brutal, scheming beasts.’” Yet three years before, in summer of 1942, Twentieth Century-Fox released a B-film that is hardly less virulent, and the <em>Time</em>s, though finding it a &#8220;mediocre melodrama,&#8221; paid homage to its authenticity in pinpointing &#8220;details about incidents of espionage plotted in Los Angeles&#8217;s Japanese colony.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/LITTLE-TOKYO-poster-cropped.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-24115 alignright" title="LITTLE TOKYO poster cropped" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/LITTLE-TOKYO-poster-cropped.jpg" alt="" width="264" height="663" /></a>Little Tokyo, U.S.A.</em> (1942) centers on plainclothes detective Michael Steele, who suspects a Japanese family of receiving radio messages from Tokyo. After Steele&#8217;s friend Oshima agrees to check around, his corpse is found decapitated. Pursuing the case, Steele is brought up against a gang led by Takimura, an obsequious importer, and a German-American called Hendricks. As head of the local radio station, Hendricks allows the Japanese agents to use the transmitter to send messages to Tokyo. Hendricks also happens to be the boss of Steele’s girlfriend Mavis, a radio commentator.</p>
<p>Steele’s investigation is blocked when he can’t find the radio used by one of the gang to receive instructions from Tokyo. Takimura murders Teru, Hendricks’ Japanese mistress, and Steele is framed for the crime. Steele is in prison when Pearl Harbor is attacked. As “dangerous aliens” are rounded up, he escapes and finds Takimura’s hideout. Mavis, who has been skeptical of Steele’s suspicions, is taken captive by the gang. Takimura finds Steele hiding out in the city morgue. But when they confront Steele he springs a trap of his own: cops burst in and seize the conspirators. The film concludes with Mavis broadcasting the need to stay vigilant.</p>
<p>If <em>Samurai</em> crudely employs techniques of current semidocumentary (voice-over narrator, newsreel footage, some location shooting), <em>Little Tokyo, USA</em> remakes the G-man film into an affair of domestic espionage. We get the familiar frame-ups, the silhouettes and night streets, and the montages of headlines and police dispatches. Given how supple Fox’s B-pictures often were in the 1930s, with <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2007/03/16/charlie-meet-kentaro/" target="_blank">the Moto and Chan films</a> and the Sherlock Holmes series, this is a very routine affair. The major Japanese villains are played by Caucasians in Yellowface; even the ubiquitous Abner Biberman (in the poster at right) is recruited to look Japanese.</p>
<p>Unlike <em>Samurai</em>, <em>Little Tokyo, USA</em> indicates that there are loyal Japanese-Americans like Steele’s friend Oshima. Nonetheless, the film buys wholly into the notion of a pervasive Japanese menace. A voice-over prologue presents this as a “film document,” and provides a montage of Japanese men photographing industrial and military sites much like those Kenkichi scouted in <em>Samurai</em>. More subtly, after Pearl Harbor, members of Takimura’s gang are shown putting up signs in their shops claiming to be patriotic citizens—something that many innocent Japanese-Americans did to forestall reprisals. Takimura even establishes a charity that purportedly finances the building of bomber planes.</p>
<p>Beyond spreading a general mistrust, the film aims to justify Japanese-American internment. To do this, it has to show that, as the prologue’s voice-over puts it, before Pearl Harbor Americans had been lulled into a false sense of security by “the mouthing of self-styled patriots.” So we meet several characters who exhibit fatal naivete. Early in the film, Mavis’ broadcast voices her hopes for peaceful negotiation with the Japanese. After Japanese-Americans protest Steele’s investigation, his superior claims:</p>
<p><strong>The Japanese are peaceful, harmless, industrious citizens. They’re loyal too—most of ‘em. ‘Course there may be some rats in the bunch, but that’s nothing to get excited about. I was reading only this morning that 93 percent of the vegetable crop of California is in the control of the Japanese.</strong></p>
<p>Steele replies:</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, I know. They’ve got farms right next to all the airplane factories, and the dams, and the oil-storage concentrations. </strong></p>
<p>He goes on to claim that the farmers lose money, but they’re subsidized by funding from a Tokyo bank.</p>
<p>On the other side, Takimura warns his gang that internment is what he fears most. “Mass evacuation will defeat our operation here.” Fortunately, he remarks confidently, evacuation will be blocked by Japanese civic groups and “certain sympathetic American interests.” This phrase casts anyone who might object as an unwitting tool of the Axis.</p>
<p>A new problem arises when the film must admit that not all 110,000 people of Japanese ancestry on the coast could be Fifth Columnists. So, like the government documentary, and like the <em>LA Times</em> news photo of grinning men bound for a resettlement camp, <em>Little Tokyo, USA</em> treats the innocent evacuees as accepting internment in a cheerful spirit. It’s proof of their patriotism and their contribution to the war effort. Here are the film’s final scenes, including some documentary footage of relocation and the empty streets of Little Tokyo.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="375" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NFUeJIiDDr0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>At the denouement Steele punches Takimura (&#8220;That&#8217;s for Pearl Harbor, you slant-eyed&#8211;&#8221;) and Steele’s captain abandons his misplaced sympathy by clobbering the &#8220;squarehead&#8221; Hendricks. In the final scene, Mavis, her eyes now open, uses her broadcast to explain the need for some to sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>And so in the interests of national safety, all Japanese, whether citizens or not, are being evacuated from strategic military zones on the Pacific Coast. Unfortunately, in time of war the loyal must suffer inconvenience for the disloyal. </strong></p>
<p>As happens today, those calling for sacrifice from others usually give up nothing themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I offer no fancy analysis of these humdrum films. It simply seemed to me that, on the eve of the anniversary of the US bombing of Nagasaki, it would be worth remembering how quickly Americans in a state of war could find enemies among civilians overseas and in our cities here. Among us today there are many who would happily call for some American minority to be rounded up, locked up, sent away, put out of sight somehow. Look around you, as Resnais and Cayrol remind us in <em>Night and Fog</em>, and you will see the eager faces of future jailers.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thanks to the staff of the Royal Film Archive of Belgium for permitting me to view <em>Samurai</em>. On the role of race in the Pacific War, see John Dower&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Without-Mercy-Power-Pacific/dp/0394751728/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375928735&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=john+dower+war+without+mercy" target="_blank"><em>War without Mercy</em></a>. The Dies Committee, later known as the House Un-American Activities Committee, produced <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~eo9066/1942/ROJA/Report_on_Japanese_Activities_1942.html" target="_blank">a report</a> on Japanese espionage that makes astonishing reading. Here is one passage:</p>
<p><strong>California, with its mild climate and extraordinary agricultural resources, delighted the industrious Japanese. In fact, some of their vernacular newspapers went so far as to call California &#8221;the New Japan.&#8221; They were not content to remain day laborers, as had the Chinese, but rapidly acquired their own land, or leased farm land which they frequently worked to depletion. Their women worked alongside the men in the fields for long hours, often with their babies strapped to their backs. Whole towns became Japanese, the native white population gradually leaving areas where the Japanese settled, since competition with them was so difficult if not impossible. They were assertive and aggressive, and did not achieve the reputation for honesty and faithfulness that was enjoyed by the Chinese. California fearfully envisioned the complete control of her agricultural land by the acquisitive Japanese, and became thoroughly aroused. Feeling ran high, but there was little of the violence against the Japanese which had unfortunately marked the agitation for exclusion of the Chinese.</strong></p>
<p>The <em>New York Times</em> review of <em>Samurai</em> appeared on 24 August 1945, p. 7. <em>Variety</em>&#8216;s review of <em>Little Tokyo, U.S.A. </em> appeared in the issue of 8 July 1942, p. 8, and the <em>Times</em> review was published on 7 August 1942, p. 13.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the documentary<em> Japanese Relocation</em> appropriates portions of Virgil Thomson&#8217;s scores for Pare Lorentz&#8217;s documentary <em>The River</em> (1938), and I think I heard a bit from <em>The Plow That Broke the Plains</em> (1936) as well. Presumably the government owned the rights.</p>
<p>Every day brings a fresh example of highly-placed and lunatic bigotry against immigrants to the US. Consider <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/05/cathie-adams-immigration-reform_n_3709639.html?utm_hp_ref=politics" target="_blank">this</a>. Or <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/07/racial-overtones-mark-protests-outside-obama-speech/2629687/" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>The photograph below of a Nagasaki in 1946 is from the National Archives; I have taken it from the site <a href="http://aboutjapan.japansociety.org/content.cfm/nagasaki_atomic_bomb" target="_blank">About Japan</a>. The quotation at bottom is from <em>Life</em> magazine, 20 August 1945, 27.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Nagasaki-lanscape-600.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24095" title="Bombed Industrial Nagasaki Landscape" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Nagasaki-lanscape-600.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="456" /></a></p>
<p><em>Seventy-five hours after the world&#8217;s first atomic bombing, an interval marked by President Truman&#8217;s demand for unconditional surrender, the second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, shipbuilding port and industrial center. This bomb was described as an &#8220;improved type,&#8221; easier to construct and productive of a greater blast. It landed in the middle of Nagasaki&#8217;s industries and disemboweled the crowded city. Unlike the Hiroshima bomb, it dug a huge crater, destroying a square mile&#8211;30% of the city.</em></p>
<p><em>When the bomb went off, a flier on another mission 250 miles away saw a huge ball of fiery yellow erupt. Others, nearer at hand, saw a big mushroom of smoke and dust billow darkly up to 20,000 feet and then the same detached floating head observed at Hiroshima. Twelve hours later Nagasaki was a mass of flame, palled by acrid smoke, its pyre still visible to pilots 200 miles away.</em></p>
<p><em>The bombers reported that black smoke had shot up like a tremendous, ugly waterspout. Physicists at the bomber base theorized that this smoke was the pulverized fragments of the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works. With grim satisfaction they declared that the &#8220;improved&#8221; second atomic bomb had already made the first one obsolete.</em></p>

<p><em>Donald Westlake in 2001. Photo by David Jennings.</em></p>
<p>DB here:</p>
<p>There can be no question of my doing justice to the writing of Donald Westlake, also known as Richard Stark, Tucker Coe, and other cover names. For background you can go to <a href="http://www.donaldwestlake.com/" target="_blank">his fine site</a> or to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_E._Westlake" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, or <a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8876204/donald-westlake-man-created-parker-quest-perfect-character" target="_blank">this warm appreciation by Michael Weinreb</a>. Here I just want to pay brief tribute to a writer who, like Rex Stout and Patricia Highsmith, seemed incapable of composing a bad sentence. Elmore Leonard gets deserved recognition as a laconic master of language, but Westlake was no less skillful. In some ways he was more ambitious and audacious.</p>
<p>He was astoundingly versatile. He wrote straight novels, erotica, and science-fiction, but fame came to him when he worked in three registers: terse toughness, wry comedy, and straight-up farce.</p>
<p>As Westlake he wrote psychological thrillers. Best-known, I think, is <em>The Ax</em> (1997), about a downsized executive eliminating the competition for jobs that might come up. Also as Westlake, he wrote comic crime novels. Many of these center on a gang of inept working-class thieves led, if that&#8217;s the word, by the hapless John Dortmunder. As Richard Stark, Westlake wrote very hard-boiled novels about Parker (no first name), an utterly emotionless professional thief, and his sometime assistant Alan Grofield.</p>
<p>Westlake rang many variations, both high and low, on the heist formula, and his plotting was fastidious. He made one story do for two novels by telling it from different viewpoints (<em>Slayground</em> and <em>The Blackbirder, </em>both 1971). The plot of one Dortmunder novel, <em>Drowned Hopes</em> (1990), was so complicated that it left interstices for Westlake&#8217;s friend Joe Gores to fill in an intersecting novel, <em>32 Cadillacs</em> (1992).</p>
<p>Nearly all the Stark books have a strict four-part structure. Part one takes place in the present, leading to a crisis. Parts two and three flash back to what led up to the book&#8217;s first chapter. Part four finishes up the action left hanging in part one. This pet pattern was both a trademark and a self-imposed constraint that Stark-Westlake had to overcome in every book. Today&#8217;s young fiction writers could learn construction from these trim, no-nonsense tales.</p>
<p>At the moment, though, our topic is style. Here is the opening of Stark&#8217;s <em>The Mourner</em> (1963).</p>
<p><strong>When the guy with asthma finally came in from the fire escape, Parker rabbit-punched him and took his gun away. The asthmatic hit the carpet, but there&#8217;d been another one out there, and he landed on Parker&#8217;s back like a duffel bag with arms. Parker fell turning, so that the duffel bag would be on the bottom, but it didn&#8217;t quite work out that way. They landed sideways, joltingly, and the gun skittered away into the darkness.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There was no light in the room at all. The window was a paler rectangle sliced out of blackness. Parker and the duffel bag wrestled around on the floor a few minutes, neither getting an advantage because the duffel bag wouldn&#8217;t give up his first hold but just clung to Parker&#8217;s back. Then the asthmatic got his wind and balance back and joined in, trying to kick Parker&#8217;s head loose. Parker knew the room even in the dark, since he&#8217;d lived there the last week, so he rolled over to where he knew there wasn&#8217;t any furniture. The asthmatic, coming after him, fell over a chair.</strong></p>
<p>The economy is remarkable. There&#8217;s no explicit indication that we&#8217;re in a hotel room, or that Parker has been waiting for the invasion. This is <em>in medias res</em> storytelling, a Stark specialty. (Many of the novels begin with a &#8220;When&#8230;&#8221; clause.) In a couple more paragraphs, Parker gets the advantage and knocks out both men. &#8220;The asthmatic went down, hitting furniture on the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The faintly amused tone here (being caught by &#8220;a duffel bag with arms,&#8221; kicking a man&#8217;s head &#8220;loose,&#8221; falling over a chair) is stronger in the Stark novels centered on Grofield. He&#8217;s a semi-professional actor who goes in for theft to finance his small-town theatre troupe. Parker is introverted, stoic, and borderline sociopathic, while Grofield is laid-back, good-natured, and quick with backchat. The opening of <em>The Damsel</em> (1967), parallel to that of <em>The Mourner</em>, shifts toward the deadpan comedy of the Dortmunder capers.</p>
<p><strong>Grofield opened his right eye, and there was a girl climbing in the window. He closed that eye, opened the left, and she was still there. Gray skirt, blue sweater, blond hair, and long tanned legs straddling the windowsill.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But this room was on the fifth floor of the hotel. There was nothing outside that window but air and a poor view of Mexico City.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grofield&#8217;s room was in semidarkness, because he&#8217;d been taking an after-lunch snooze. The girl obviously thought the place was empty, and once she was inside she headed striaght for the door.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grofield lifted his head and said, &#8220;If you&#8217;re my fairy godmother, I want my back scratched.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Opening one eye, then the other: The micro-action is as vivid as Rod Steiger or Eli Wallach playing up to us in a Leone film. The tone has changed too. Words like &#8220;snooze&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t show up in a pure Parker novel, I think. And now we get some scene-setting, but that&#8217;s because the wounded Grofield, flat on his back, can&#8217;t give us a tour of the room through physical action. What replaces Parker&#8217;s tussle is sexy banter. After the woman finds a suitcase full of cash, she gets suspicious. Grofeld explains: &#8220;I wear money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, here&#8217;s extravagant burlesque from a non-Dortmunder story, <em>Help I Am Being Held Prisoner</em> (1974). The plot, about a practical joker who is thrown into prison among hard cases, is preposterously enjoyable, but again it&#8217;s the style that arrests, and convulses. The protagonist is accompanying Eddie, a demented ex-officer after they&#8217;ve broken out of the joint, sneaked onto a military base, and settled down in the mess for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Speaking of landing on mines,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that reminds me of another funny story.&#8221; And he proceeded to tell it. Soon our food came, and so did the wine, but Eddie kept on telling me his reminiscences. Friends of his had fallen under tanks, walked into airplane propellors, inadvertently bumped their elbows against the firing mechanism of thousand-pound bombs, and walked backwards off the flight deck of an aircraft carrier while backing up to take a group photograph. Other friends had misread the control directions on a robot tank and driven it through a Pennsylvania town&#8217;s two hundredth anniversay celebration square dance, had fired a bazooka while it was facing the wrong way, had massacred a USO Gilbert and Sullivan troupe rehearsing <em>The Mikado</em> under the mistaken impression they were peaceful Vietnamese villagers, and had ordered a nearby enlisted man to look in that mortar and see why the shell hadn&#8217;t come out.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It began after a while to seem as though Eddie&#8217;s military career had been an endless red-black vista of explosions, fires, and crumpling destruction, all intermixed with hoarse cries, anonymous thuds, and terminal screams. Eddie recounted these disasters in his normal bloodless style, with touches of that dry avuncular humor he&#8217;d displayed during our hour at the bar. I managed to eat very little of my veal parmigiana&#8211;it kept looking like a body fragment&#8211;but became increasingly sober nonetheless. A brandy later with coffee, accompanied by a Korean War story about a friend of Eddie&#8217;s trapped in a box canyon for nine days by a combination of a blizzard and a North Korean offensive, who kept himself alive by sawing off his own wounded leg and eating steaks from it, but who later died in Honolulu from gangrene of the stomach, didn&#8217;t help much.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a challenge to a novelist to tell us something funny is coming up and then to make it much funnier than we expect, turning it into a crescendo of slapstick violence. It&#8217;s partly the appositional phrases, which pile up mishaps, and partly the mock-heroic word choices. Would you (or I) come up with epithets like &#8220;endless red-black vista&#8221; or &#8220;gangrene of the stomach&#8221;? Could we pull off that satiric stab of a massacre occurring &#8220;under the mistaken impression they were peaceful Vietnamese villagers&#8221;? Extra-credit assignment: Diagram the last sentence. Could we write something so complicated and impeccable?</p>
<p>By these standards, most of our novelists, beach-book maestros or middlebrow bestsellers or literary lions, don&#8217;t cut it.</p>
<p>Many films have been drawn from Westlake&#8217;s books. <em>Made in USA</em> (1966) and <em>Point Blank</em> (1967) are probably the most famous, but both are very free treatments. Closer to the brusque Stark spirit is <em>The Outfit</em> (1974), while the French version of <em>The Ax</em> (2005, by Costa-Gavras) is quite watchable. I haven&#8217;t seen the recent <em>Parker</em>, with Jason Statham, yet. Sad to report, the several Dortmunder movie adaptations don&#8217;t make me laugh much. But Westlake had no illusions: &#8220;A movie is not the book it came from and in almost every case it shouldn&#8217;t be the book it came from.&#8221; Westlake wrote screenplays too, notably <em>The Stepfather</em> (1987) and <em>The Grifters</em> (1990).</p>
<p>He died in 2008. He seems to have been the most easygoing, unpretentious writing machine you&#8217;d ever want to meet. The University of Chicago Press is republishing the Stark novels in <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/sites/stark/index.html" target="_blank">handsome uniform editions</a>, and there remain many other Westlakes that deserve unearthing. Read them for pleasure, for the smooth carpentry of their plots, and their cunning simplicity of style.</p>

<p><em><strong>Shokuzai</strong> (2012).</em></p>
<p>DB here:</p>
<p>This year’s trip to Brussels and the Royal Film Archive of Belgium was more low-key than usual. The Cinematek&#8217;s mini-festivals were suspended this year, with <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/category/festivals-cinedecouvertes/" target="_blank">Cinédecouvertes</a> to resume next summer and the L’age d’or competition to get its own slot in the fall. The usually reliable Écran Total series at the Galeries Cinema was gone, replaced by <a href="http://www.galeries.be/program/now-on-screen/?lang=en" target="_blank">mostly recent releases</a>. The Cinematek’s <a href="http://www.cinematek.be/?node=17" target="_blank">main venue</a> was featuring America in the 1980s (not to be despised, but these items were familiar to me) and Antonioni, because of the current <a href="http://www.bozar.be/activity.php?id=13660&amp;selectiondate=2013-05-06&amp;lng=en" target="_blank">exhibition devoted to him</a> in the Musée des Beaux-Arts. And even my archive viewing was slimmed down to only a few days, as I watched some 1940s American features too obscure even to circulate on bootleg DVDs.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t exactly bereft of choices, and I could occupy my time preparing for my Antwerp lectures on Ozu, but I was angling for something special. Luckily, our old friend Gabrielle Claes, recently retired as Director of the Cinematek, called my attention to a one-off showing of Kurosawa Kiyoshi’s <em>Shokuzai</em> (&#8220;Penitence,&#8221; 2012) at <a href="http://www.cinema-vendome.be/" target="_blank">Cinéma Vendôme</a>, a local arthouse. The bonus: Kurosawa in person! So of course Gabrielle and I went.</p>
<p>Before and after the movie, I began thinking about his career and his place in recent Japanese film history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Making waves in the 90s</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Sonatine-400.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24011" title="Sonatine 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Sonatine-400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="213" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong> Sonatine</strong> (1993).</em></p>
<p>During the 1990s a new generation of Japanese directors came to international attention. Thanks to home video formats, as well as to a rising taste for international crime and horror films, western audiences became aware of filmmakers from many countries who unabashedly worked in low-end popular genres. The success of Hong Kong films in 1980s festivals had made programmers open to Asian pulp fictions. Soon commercial companies saw a fan market for video versions of movies that were unlikely to get theatrical distribution outside Japan. These films changed forever the image of Japanese cinema as a refined and dignified tradition.</p>
<p>Admittedly, Western views of Japanese film were probably too sanitized. Ozu never shrank from bawdy humor, Mizoguchi could display acute suffering, and Kurosawa’s <em>Yojimbo</em> and <em>Sanjuro</em> were exceptionally bloody by 1960s American standards. Still, things had gotten quite wild in later years. Films that weren’t widely exported, such as those exploiting juvenile-delinquency, yakuza intrigues, and swordplay, as well as the softcore erotica known as “pink” films, would have shown western audiences something quite surprising. In the 1980s, charmers like <em>Tampopo, The Funeral</em>, and other export releases could hardly have prepared audiences abroad for the cinema of shock that was becoming common at home. Perhaps only Ishii Sôgo’s <em>Crazy Family (</em>1984), widely circulated in Europe and America, hinted at what was ahead.</p>
<p>The oldest provocateur was Kitano Takeshi (born, like me, in 1947), who came to directing after a solid career as a comedian. His <em>Sonatine</em> (1993) established him as master of the impassively violent, disturbingly amusing gangster movie. I don’t think anyone can forget <em>Sonatine’</em>s elevator-car shootout, which is unleashed after an awkward, semicomic passage of passengers behaving as we all do in an elevator, adopting neutral expressions and avoiding each other&#8217;s eyes. The most celebrated director of this group, Kitano influenced action filmmakers around the world and probably helped spark a revival of interest in classic yakuza pictures.</p>
<p>Other directors were younger and got their start in more marginal filmmaking. Tsukamoto Shinya had worked in Super-8 since childhood and made his breakthrough film, <em>Tetsuo</em> (1989) in 16mm, which became a cult hit on worldwide video. Soon <em>Tetsuo II</em> (1992), <em>Tokyo Fist</em> (1995), <em>Bullet Ballet</em> (1998), and other films showcased a frenetic, assaultive style that was the cinematic equivalent of thrash-rock. Miike Takeshi made several V-films before he hit international screens with <em>Audition</em> (1999), and soon his earlier theatrical releases <em>Shinjuku Triad Society</em> (1995) and <em>Fudoh: The New Generation</em> (1996) became staples of cult screenings and video collecting. Miike pushed things over the edge. Even Kitano did not dare to show a schoolgirl assassin firing deadly darts from her vagina.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Fudoh-3001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24039" title="Fudoh 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Fudoh-3001.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="155" /></a></p>
<p>I don’t mean to suggest that these directors were sensationalistic all the time. Miike made children’s films, a discreet heart-warmer (<em>The Bird People in China</em>, 1997), a mystical drama (<em>Big Bang Love Juvenile A</em>, 2005), and classical swordplay sagas (<em>Thirteen Assassins</em>, 2010). Kitano developed his interest in prolonged adolescence through sentimental drama (<em>A Scene at the Sea</em>, 1991), Chaplinesque road movie (<em>Kikujiro</em>, 1999), symbolic pageant (<em>Dolls</em>, 2002), and self-referential absurdity (<em>Takeshi&#8217;s</em>, 2005, and others). Still, these two directors have often returned to the downmarket genres that launched their reputations.</p>
<p>Nor do I want to suggest that all the filmmakers emerging to wider awareness at this time were roughnecks. Kore-eda Hirokazu began his career in documentary films, followed by the solemn, elemental <em>Maborosi</em> (1995). Kawase Naomi, one of Japan’s few women directors, won acclaim with the sensitive rural drama <em>Suzaku</em> (1997), and Suo Masayuki became a top-grossing export with his satiric comedies <em>Sumo Do, Sumo Don’t</em> (1992) and <em>Shall We Dance?</em> (1996). Yet Kore-eda, widely respected for his nuanced family films, made a movie centering on a sex dolly (<em>Air Doll</em>, 2009), and Kawase had worked for years on autobiographical documentaries dealing bluntly with family tensions, old age, and women’s oppression. Suo’s debut was a pink film called <em>Abnormal Family: My Older Brother’s Bride</em> (1984) in which an affectionate parody of Ozu’s style was used to present copulation, teenage sex work, and a golden shower.</p>
<p>In sum, in Japan the distance between serious art and more sensual, not to say shocking, cinema isn’t that great. To take a more recent example, who would have expected that the director of the quiet, deeply moving <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2009/04/16/passion-mortality-and-everyday-life/" target="_blank"><em>Departures</em> </a>(2008; Academy Award, Best Foreign-Language Film) would have learned his craft in a series centering on men who grope women on commuter trains? (Sample title: <em>Molester’s Train: Seiko’s Ass</em>, 1985.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mysteries, mundane and supernatural</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Doll-4001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24048" title="Doll 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Doll-4001.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="226" /></a></p>
<p><strong><em>Shokuzai.</em></strong></p>
<p>Kurosawa Kiyoshi’s career fits the trend I’ve sketched. Born in 1955, he started with pink films and V-cinema, but the theatrical release <em>Cure</em> (1997) won festival berths and international distribution. It presents the now-familiar mixture of mystery story and supernatural tale, in which a detective with personal problems investigates serial killings and begins to suspect that the murders are performed under some mesmeric influence. In <em>Charisma</em> (1999) the supernatural elements dominate, as a police officer tries to understand the powers of a tree that can magically regenerate itself. <em>Pulse</em> (2001) locates the otherworldly forces in the Internet, where ghosts take over people’s lives and eventually lead humans to flee Tokyo.</p>
<p>Kurosawa’s films became perhaps too quickly identified with what was known as J-horror. His taut, slowly unfolding plots and calm but menacing style did have something in common with the <em>Ring</em> series (1998-2000) that was becoming popular at the time. At the same time, Kurosawa draws on a some story elements common across Asian crime and horror films:  revenge, often by a parent or elder figure in the name of a lost child; the suggestion that childhood, especially that of girls, has a corrupt and sinister side; and a sense that modern technology such as computers and cellphones harbor demonic threats. But I think that his films were more thematically ambitious, even pretentious, especially in the case of <em>Charisma,</em> with its ambiguous ecological symbolism. And like his peers, he wasn’t interested only in suspense and shock. His mainstream family drama <em>Tokyo Sonata</em> (2008) attracted western viewers with no knowledge of his spookier side.</p>
<p>The <em>policier</em> aspect is evident from the start of <em>Shokuzai</em>. Originally a five-part TV drama broadcast in weekly installments, it starts with the rape and murder of a schoolgirl, Emili. Her four playmates have seen her attacker ask her to leave the playground with him, so when she’s found dead, the police and Emili’s mother Asako press the girls to identify him. Through fear or trauma, none of the girls can remember what he looked like. Asako summons all four to her home and demands penitence from them in the future—in ways each one must find for herself.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Shokuzai-3-3001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24045" title="Shokuzai 3 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Shokuzai-3-3001.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>After this prologue,<em> Shokuzai</em> downplays supernatural elements in favor of character studies of the four surviving girls, with a “chapter” devoted to each. The young women live separate lives and their paths don’t intersect; only the implacable Asako reappears in each thread. By the final installment, Asako has more or less given up tracking the killer, but when one young woman accidentally recognizes him, on TV, Asako pursues him and discovers the roots of the crime in her own past.</p>
<p>This is pretty much modern thriller territory, with a whiff of Barbara Vine/Ruth Rendell in the film’s effort to trace how a single event resonates terribly through innocent lives. As with such thrillers, the strength of <em>Shokuzai</em> seems to me to lie largely in characterization and atmospherics. Each young woman is given a distinctive personality, and each one’s professional and personal life fifteen years after the crime is presented with a teasing, hypnotic deliberation. Sae is a meek, sexually immature nurse who is lured into marriage with a rich former schoolmate; his seemingly harmless obsession turns domineering. Maki becomes a schoolteacher herself, and her relentless, demanding methods soon antagonize the local parents—until she unexpectedly proves herself heroic. Akiko has become a <em>hikikomori</em>, a recluse, and is only briefly drawn out of her drowsy existence by the daughter of her brother’s girlfriend. The good-natured little girl in effect reintroduces Akiko to childhood. In the penultimate chapter, the sexual bargainer Yuka seeks to seduce her brother-in-law and to take revenge upon her sister for being their mother’s favorite.</p>
<p>Each young woman is associated with an object or gesture seen in the prologue: a French doll, a bloody blouse, a policeman’s kindly squeeze on the shoulder. At one level, these bits of the past take on psychological impact. The trauma around Emili&#8217;s death suggests sources of the grown-up women’s neurotic behavior. Maki, the girl who after the killing rushes frantically through the school looking for someone in authority, becomes an all-controlling schoolteacher. Akiko’s bloody school blouse will find its fulfillment in a brutal crime involving a girl’s toy.</p>
<p>Yet these associations carry extra resonances. It’s partly because of the quietly ominous way Kurosawa films commonplace objects like a ruby ring or a jump rope. Maybe there is a whiff of the supernatural after all, given the unexpected connections revealed between the men in the women’s later lives and the little girls’ fetishes and rituals. Fate plays such cruel tricks that it might as well be malevolent magic.</p>
<p>The demand for expiation and the mother&#8217;s implacable intervention in an investigation will remind many viewers of Bong Joon-ho’s <em>Mother</em> (2009, South Korea) and Nakashima Tetsuya’s <em>Confessions</em> (2010). Asako&#8217;s characterization gets fleshed out in the fifth episode, which presents two crucial flashbacks leading up to the crime. One even replays a moment leading up to the murder, supplying a previously withheld reverse-shot <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/06/26/twice-told-tales-mildred-pierce/" target="_blank">in the manner of <em>Mildred Pierce</em>’s replay</a>. (Some things don’t change.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Shokuzai-2-300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24016" title="Shokuzai 2 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Shokuzai-2-300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>Presumably the recurring flashbacks to the prologue were also motivated by the rhythm of the weekly TV broadcasts. Viewers couldn’t be expected to recall everything from earlier installments.</p>
<p>You can object, as critics have, that the revelations in <em>Shokuzai</em>’s finale are creaky and far-fetched. Raúl Ruiz, in <em>Mysteries of Lisbon</em>, embraces <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2010/10/11/seduced-by-structure/" target="_blank">the arbitrariness of old-fashioned plotting</a>, with its felicitous accidents, secret messages, and hidden identities. He scatters these devices freely throughout his story, making them basic ingredients of his film’s world. Instead, Kurosawa introduces most such devices at the last minute, which makes them more surprising but also more apparently makeshift. Still, you can argue that once you eliminate purely supernatural causes for the creepy things we see and hear, audiences will embrace convoluted plots (as again, in <em>Confessions</em>) to rationalize their thrills. As so often in popular narrative, <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2010/08/26/no-coincidence-no-story/" target="_blank">no coincidence, no story</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Quiet elegance</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Questioning-400.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24049" title="Questioning 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Questioning-400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="264" /></a></p>
<p>Kurosawa uses long takes, fairly distant framings, and solemn tracking shots to heighten an atmosphere of dread. The questioning of the children is played out in an extreme long shot, refusing exaggeration but conveying very well the flat, obdurate refusals confronting the cop.</p>
<p>In the Q &amp; A after the screening, Kurosawa explained that he didn&#8217;t alter his filming style much for the television series, although he found himself writing more dialogue than he would have included in a theatrical feature. His  visual technique displays a dry, precise elegance&#8211;the Japanese might say it possesses <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibui" target="_blank">shibui</a></em>&#8211; and it has, as far as I know, no equivalent in current American cinema. The compositions are painstakingly exact, though they&#8217;re not as rigidly geometrical as <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2007/01/16/shot-consciousness/" target="_blank">Kitano’s planimetric images</a> and they don&#8217;t <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2007/02/14/welcome-back-suo-san/" target="_blank">self-consciously evoke Ozu</a> in the way Suo&#8217;s do.</p>
<p>Everything lies in plain sight. The bright, saturated tones of the childhood prologue contrasts sharply with the wan color schemes throughout the present-day sequences.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Doorway-3001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24051" title="Doorway 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Doorway-3001.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="170" /></a>     <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apartment-300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24052" title="Apartment 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apartment-300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="170" /></a></p>
<p>Kurosawa&#8217;s staging has a clarity and point that&#8217;s rare today. He often lets significant action unfold without interruption. For example, in Yuka&#8217;s flower shop, he gives us a shot lasting nearly a minute. Yuka&#8217;s sister has come to voice her suspicion that her husband has had sex with Yuka. Kurosawa moves the two women around the frame discreetly, sometimes hiding their facial reactions, and <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2010/06/01/the-cross/" target="_blank">using the Cross</a> in to shift their positions both laterally and in depth. A single step forward can mark rising tension as the sister demands an explanation, and a retreat from the foreground can create a mini-suspense about Yuka&#8217;s reaction.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/1a.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24060" title="1a" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/1a.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="167" /></a>     <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/1b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24061" title="1b" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/1b.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="167" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/1c.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24062" title="1c" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/1c.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="167" /></a>     <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/1d.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24063" title="1d" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/1d.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="167" /></a></p>
<p>After hiding Yuka&#8217;s reaction in the distance, Kurosawa creates a mini-climax by having her turn abruptly to the camera before bending over and sobbing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/1e.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24064" title="1e" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/1e.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="167" /></a>     <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/1f.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24065" title="1f" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/1f.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="167" /></a></p>
<p>Kurosawa saves the cut, <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/06/18/david-koepp-making-the-world-movie-sized/" target="_blank">as David Koepp might say</a>, in order to ratchet the drama up. In a closer view we can watch the sister, ashamed of her suspicions, consoling Yuka and succumbing to her lies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-end.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24057" title="1 end" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-end.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="167" /></a>     <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2a.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24059" title="2a" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2a.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="167" /></a></p>
<p>Contrary to what proponents of <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2007/05/27/intensified-continuity-revisited/" target="_blank">intensified continuity</a> will tell you, you can build an engrossing scene without fast cutting, tight close-ups, and arcing camera movements. Like American directors of the studio era, Kurosawa always knows the best place to put the camera, and he keeps things simple and direct.</p>
<p>Kurosawa&#8217;s patient, compact staging has its counterparts in the work of Claire Denis, Manuel de Oliveira, and many other European filmmakers. It&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s a bit unexpected in the 1990s Japanese iconoclasts. For all their self-conscious extremism, they have wound up reinvigorating certain classic techniques of cinematic expression. This is just one of many reasons to catch <em>Shokuzai</em> on a screen, big or little, near you.</p>
<hr />
<p>You can see some trailers and extracts from <em>Shokuzai</em> <a href="http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=213377.html" target="_blank">here</a>, but you have to sit through a wretched Peugeot ad every  time.</p>
<p><em>Shokuzai</em> is <a href="http://www.cinema-vendome.be/les_films/prochainement/shokuzai_celles_qui_voulaient_se_souvenir_shokuzai_celles_qui_voulaient_oublier" target="_blank">coming to the Vendôme</a> on 24 July.</p>
<p>On the earthy side of Japanese culture, which I think feeds into the 1990s trends I&#8217;ve mentioned, see Ian Baruma&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Behind-mask-transvestites-gangsters-drifters/dp/0394537750/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373969809&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr1&amp;keywords=ian+buruma+earth+mother" target="_blank"><em>Behind the Mask</em></a>.</p>
<p><strong>P.S. 23 July 2013:</strong> Adam Torel of the ambitious <a href="http://thirdwindowfilms.com/" target="_blank">Third Window Films</a> writes to tell me that the company is releasing <em>Eyes of the Spider</em> and <em>Serpent&#8217;s Path</em> on DVD in September. Third Window distributes other recent Japanese films, including items by Miike and Tsukamoto.</p>

<p>Kristin here:</p>
<p>For a second year running I unexpectedly ended up attending Il Cinema Ritrovato in Bologna alone. (For the 2012 report, see <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/07/08/solo-in-bologna/" target="_blank">here</a>.) Last year David&#8217;s back went out shortly before we were due to leave. This year an exceptionally long stretch of days with heavy thunderstorms resulted in flooding in our basement (where many of our books reside). I had already been in London for nearly three weeks and was planning to meet David in Bologna. Instead, he valiantly stayed home to deal with the unwanted water, and I went on to the expanding smorgasbord of films presented by the festival.</p>
<p>The programmers are limited to their existing venues: the relatively small Mastroianni and Scorsese auditoriums in the Cineteca&#8217;s building, the larger Arlecchino and Jolly commercial cinemas, and the vast space of the Piazza Maggiore for the nightly open-air screenings starting at 10 pm. This year for the first time, to accommodate the many films, post-dinner screenings, starting at 9:30, 9:45, or 10 pm, were scheduled in the Scorsese and Mastroianni.</p>
<p>Faced with so many options, one could only focus on a few of the bounteous threads of programming. I opted to see as many of the early Japanese sound films as possible, the early (pre-mid-1960s) Chris Marker works, and the annual Cento Anni Fa series, this year presenting a sampling of films from 1913, the year when worldwide the cinema seemed to take an extraordinary leap forward in complexity and inventiveness. Whenever there was a gap, I could fit in items from the other threads: European widescreen movies; cinema of the 1930s that presaged the coming war; a retrospective of the work of Soviet director Olga Preobrezhenskaja, another devoted to Vittorio de Sica, primarily as an actor, more Chaplin restorations from the Cineteca&#8217;s ongoing project, the newly restored Hitchcock silents, and of course various other newly restored films. A tradition of highlighting the work of a Hollywood director has become a centerpiece of Il Cinema Ritrovato, with the subject this year being Allan Dwan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Japanese Talkies, Part 2</strong></p>
<p>Last year I caught only a few of the films in the retrospective of early Japanese sound films. I regretted not being able to see more, but the Ivan Pyriev and Jean Grémillon threads lured me away. This year the rival was Chris Marker, but I determined that by careful planning, I could fit almost everything in both retrospectives into my schedule. These became my top priorities.</p>
<p>The Japanese series is ongoing and organized not by auteurs but by film companies. The programmers were again Alexander Jacoby and Johan Nordström, whose encyclopedic knowledge of the history of Japanese studios of the 1930s made <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Wife-Be-like-a-Rose-2.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-23943" title="Wife Be like a Rose 2" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Wife-Be-like-a-Rose-2.jpg" alt="" width="337" height="239" /></a>for fascinating introductions. This year it was PCL and the very obscure company JO, both of which made American-style musicals in the early and mid-1930s. These were not the best films in the season, but they were highly entertaining. This series also had the advantage of being presented entirely in 35mm and with English subtitles devised years ago for traveling retrospectives.</p>
<p>I had seen only one of the films in the series, Mikio Naruse&#8217;s 1935 masterpiece, <em>Wife, Be like a Rose</em>. I didn&#8217;t remember much about it, except that it was marvelous, and it proved so on second viewing. Naruse often has been compared with Ozu, both during his active career and since. Overall, he seems to me not as great a filmmaker, but <em>Wife, Be like a Rose </em>must be among his best films and would undoubtedly rank alongside some of Ozu&#8217;s work of this period. A <em>moga</em> (modern girl) is upset that her father has deserted his family in Tokyo and established another family in the countryside. Determined to drag him back to his familial responsibilities, the daughter confronts the possibility that he was right in leaving her mother. The film is shot in a somewhat Ozu-like style, with low camera heights and across-the-line shot/reverse shots. Still, there is no slavish imitation (the climax is filled with camera movements), and Naruse&#8217;s film is both moving and stylistically engaging.</p>
<p>Naruse was the only director with two films in the retrospective. His <em>Five Men in the Circus, </em>also released in 1935, was a less ambitious work than <em>Wife, Be like a Rose</em>, but it was an entertaining story of musicians on the road earning a living during the Depression, encountering disappointments in work and love.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ino-and-Mon-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-23948" title="Ino and Mon 1" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ino-and-Mon-1.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="214" /></a>Naruse has already gained a modern reputation in the West, but for some the discovery of the season was Sotoji Kimura, whose <em>Ino and Mon</em> was well received. As with so many of this thread&#8217;s films, its subject was a modern girl struggling with tradition. Mon, who has become pregnant and doesn&#8217;t want to marry her child&#8217;s father, returns to her country home and faces sullen opposition from her much beloved but fiercely traditional brother Ino. Aside from its realistic depiction of the countryside, the film is notable for its Soviet-style scenes of work on a nearby construction project supervised by the siblings&#8217; father (left).</p>
<p>The Japanese musicals were all charming films. <em>Romantic and Crazy</em> (1934) starred the popular comic performer Kenichi Enomoto, better known as Enoken. (In the West, he is most familiar from his comic role in Akira Kurosawa&#8217;s third feature, <em>The</em> <em>Men Who Tread on the Tiger&#8217;s Tail </em>[1945].) <em>Romantic and Crazy</em> is basically a college musical imitating the early 1930s films of Eddie Cantor&#8211;and at <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Kochiyama-Soshun.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-23952" title="Kochiyama Soshun" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Kochiyama-Soshun.jpg" alt="" width="329" height="237" /></a>moments I wished I were watching an Eddie Cantor musical. The other two musicals&#8211;<em>Tipsy Life</em> (Sotoji Kimura, 1933) and <em>Chorus of One Million Voices</em> (Atsuo Tomioka, 1935)&#8211;were quite entertaining. Clearly the filmmakers felt no compunction about stealing recent American songs and setting the tunes to new Japanese lyrics. The most popular seemed to be &#8220;Yes, Yes, My Honey said Yes, Yes!&#8221; as sung by Cantor in the 1931 musical <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8LVjm36RNs" target="_blank"><em>Palmy Days</em></a>; the tune was heard in at least two of the films.</p>
<p>Another notable film was Sadao Yamanaka&#8217;s <em>Kôchiyama Sôshun </em>(1936), one of his three surviving feature films. (These and fragments of others are available on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/COMPLETE-EXISTING-YAMANAKA-Masters-Cinema/dp/B00AMGIRF2/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373856781&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=yamanaka" target="_blank">a new set</a> from Eureka! in its &#8220;Masters of Cinema&#8221; series.) It&#8217;s a strange film, partly comic but mostly a crime story. An attractive woman, played by a very young Setsuko Hara, keeps a shop owned by a local gangster, and tries to prevent her thuggish younger brother from becoming a criminal. The title character, Kôchiyama Sôshun, appears to be an idler getting by on the income from his wife&#8217;s gambling house, but he apparently has unlimited sources of money. Despite his shady background, Kôchiyama tries to help save the heroine when, after her brother has gambled away the house and shop, she is forced to sell herself into prostitution.</p>
<p>The seasons of early Japanese sound films will continue during the 2014 Il Cinema Ritrovato, with a focus on Shochiku.</p>

<p><strong>Chris Marker&#8217;s youth returns</strong></p>
<p>It has been difficult to see any of Chris Marker&#8217;s early films lately. By early I don&#8217;t mean early 1950s, but essentially anything made before <em>La jetée</em> (1962). As Florence Dauman of Argos Films explained in an introduction to one of the programs, Marker thought of the films made during his first decade as a director as mere trials and didn&#8217;t want them seen again. Fortunately Dauman and others made the decision not to honor his wishes. Perhaps Marker thought that his later films, more complex and philosophical (<em>Sans soleil</em> comes to mind), were how he wanted to be remembered. But the playful, emotional, politically committed film essays of the 1950s and early 1960s are precious and not to be abandoned. We were treated to excellent restored prints of them during the festival.</p>
<p>The only film that made me understand Marker&#8217;s reluctance to show his early work was <em>Olympia 52</em> (1952), a documentary on the Olympic Games in Helsinki. It was Marker&#8217;s first professional feature, and it is barely competent. The coverage sticks almost entirely to the track and field events, with endless 100-meter dashes, shot-puts, hurdles, high jumps, pole-vaults, and so on. The several cameras filming the events rendered very different footage, ranging from excellent to dark gray. Cut together, these shifting images look amateurish. A brief series of shots of yacht-racing, equine-jumping, and other sports leads back to more shot-puts, hurdles, pole-vaults, and so on. Valuable practice for Marker, no doubt, but a film which bears no hint of the talent soon to burst forth.</p>
<p>It was wonderful to see <em>Letter from Siberia</em> (1958) again after so many years. David and I had taught it in an introductory class in the mid-1970s. Its repeated series of shots of a bus on a street and some men doing construction work has been an example of the powers of the sound track from the very first edition of <em>Film Art</em> in 1979 to the present one.</p>
<p>There were no subtitles on the prints, and the headphone translation could never keep up with the rapid, contemplative voice that accompanied these images, so I missed much of the point of <em>Dimanche à Pékin</em> (1956) and <em>Description d&#8217;un Combat</em> (1960). Marker&#8217;s written contribution to Joris Ivens&#8217; documentary <em>&#8230;À Valparaiso</em> (1963) presaged much of his later work. His 16mm documentation of American hippies&#8217; gently protesting assault on the Pentagon in <em>La sixiéme face du Pentagone</em> (1968) made me proud to be an American (something not too easy in the light of recent events).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dwan at his peak? The 1920s</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Iron-Mask-smaller.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-23980 alignnone" title="The Iron Mask smaller" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Iron-Mask-smaller.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="274" /></a></p>
<p>I missed most of the Dwan films, but I managed to fit in three of the four from the 1920s. These did not include the 1923 Gloria Swanson vehicle <em>Zaza</em>, alas, though I heard good things about it from friends who saw it. The three I caught seemed to represent Dwan at the height of his career.</p>
<p>I had seen the other Swanson film, <em>Manhandled</em> (1924) before, but it was a treat to see it again. It&#8217;s a strange mixture of realism&#8211;most notably in the famous early scene of the working-class heroine&#8217;s commute home on a crowded subway&#8211;and an absurdly melodramatic plot in which she manages to attain the pampered stature of a kept woman while maintaining her virtue. Swanson is a delight, and the fact that the film is incomplete, missing a scene in which she demonstrates her talent for mimicry by imitating various characters, including Charlie Chaplin, is a true pity. We can only hope that a complete version will someday surface.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Kevin-Brownlow-introduces-THE-IRON-MASK.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-23967 alignright" title="Kevin Brownlow introduces THE IRON MASK" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Kevin-Brownlow-introduces-THE-IRON-MASK-247x300.jpg" alt="" width="247" height="300" /></a>Dwan&#8217;s 1927 melodrama, <em>East Side, West Side</em>, was a considerable surprise. For a director who has a reputation for making B picture in the sound era, this high-budget production seemed remarkable. The production design and cinematography were excellent, and a ship accident scene done with models was unusually convincing. The print was a fine restoration by the Museum of Modern Art. <em>The Iron Mask</em> (1929, above) was introduced by Kevin Brownlow (right), who had helped supervise the restoration.</p>
<p>As always it was a treat to hear anecdotes from the man who had the inspired idea of interviewing stars and filmmakers from the silent era before it was too late. <em>The Iron Mask</em> was another impressive print, dated 1999 and bearing a Carl Davis score. I much prefer Douglas Fairbanks in his<a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2008/11/26/his-majesty-the-american-leaping-for-the-moon/" target="_blank"> early comedies</a> to his more famous swashbuckler films, and the story and staging in this one seemed very by-the-numbers, especially in comparison to the more imaginative <em>East Side, West Side</em>. Its main interest, and that was considerable, lay in the impressive sets designed by Ben Carré and William Cameron Menzies and its glowing cinematography by Henry Sharp.</p>
<p>By the end of the week, I was happy to have caught these particular Dwan films. From conversations with people who followed his thread more closely, I gathered that they thought the 1920s titles were the best of those shown in Bologna.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Glimpses of 1913</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ma-lamor-mio-non-muore-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23964" title="Ma l'amor mio non muore! 1" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ma-lamor-mio-non-muore-1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>There was a time when the Cento Anni Fa series, programmed by Mariann Lewinsky, was a must-see for me. With the proliferation of screenings, however, seeing all of the sessions has become difficult, and I found myself ducking in and out to catch a few items now and then. I wanted to see the new restoration of Mario Caserini&#8217;s remarkable feature, <em>Ma l&#8217;amor mio non muore!</em>, but there was something else I wanted to see playing opposite both screenings. Luckily the Cineteca has put the film out on <a href="http://cinestore.cinetecadibologna.it/bookshop/dettaglio/63" target="_blank">DVD</a>. The catalog claims that it&#8217;s the first diva film. It stars Lyda Borelli in a spectacular performance, plus it has many complex examples of what David calls tableau staging (see  <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/category/tableau-staging/" target="_blank">here</a>), especially in the amazing set in the frame above. One of the must-see films of 1913.</p>
<p>I am not a great fan of Italian (or any other) spectacles set in ancient times, and there were quite a few included in the series. They also tend to be rather long, which makes it more difficult to fit them into a packed schedule. Still, I did like <em>Spartaco ovvero il gladiatore della Tracia</em> (Giovani Enrico Vidali). Its minor actors and extras avoided giving the usual impression of people milling around in sets; they actually behaved as if they were living in real places in antiquity. The actress playing Emilia (not listed in the catalog) gave an engaging performance, quite the opposite of the diva approach, though Mario Guaita as Spartaco depended largely on rolling his eyes upward at frequent intervals to convey suffering. As Ivo Blom points out in his program notes, however, Guaita turns out to be the the first strongman figure, bending iron bars with his hands a year before Bartolomeo Pagano supposedly innovated this iconic gesture as Maciste in <em>Cabiria</em>.</p>
<p>More than that film, though, I was impressed by Luigi Maggi&#8217;s <em>La lampada della nonna</em>. It begins with an old woman knitting beside an oil lamp. When her grandchildren try to present her with a new electric one, she objects. The bulk of the film is an extended flashback set in the era of the Risorgimento, with the heroine in her youth helping to shelter a wounded officer and falling in love with them. The lamp, seen unobtrusively in the background of several shots, comes to play a key role as a signal in the climactic scene. Again there is an unusual degree of naturalness in the acting, with the extras in the military campground scene, for example, all given bits of plausible action to collectively present the impression of an actual campground. The flashback structure, framing, staging, and acting all reminded me strongly of Griffith at the same period.</p>
<p>There were slight but charming films like <em>Léonce et Toto</em>, a very funny Léonce Perret comedy (director unknown, but probably Perret). Léonce&#8217;s wife receives a tiny chihuahua as a gift and immediately dotes on it, to the point of putting it on the table at meals. The hero is disgusted and tries increasingly devious and extreme ways of getting rid of the little pest. Another was an American documentary with the irresistible title <em>Aquatic Elephants</em>. Who would not delight in five minutes of elephants rolling cheerfully in a pond while silly men try to stand on them and invariably fall into the water?</p>

<p><strong>DVDs and Blu-ray</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Criterion-presentation-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23909" title="Criterion presentation 1" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Criterion-presentation-1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="258" /></a></p>
<p>Just about every film scholar and buff in the world probably knows the Criterion Collection. As a brand, it&#8217;s sort of the Pixar of high-end home-video. We all have at least some of its releases on our shelves, whether lined up alphabetically or by director or by number. This year a session was devoted to the background of the company, with guests Jonathan Turell and Peter Becker (left and right, above). The history of Criterion is a bit complicated. Briefly, it was founded in 1984 to release laserdiscs and eventually, after the introduction of DVDs in 1997, switched to that format, eventually adding Blu-ray discs. Becker joined the company in 1993.</p>
<p>Criterion is closely linked to the historically important Janus Films, founded in 1956 and responsible for distributing many of the most famous art films of subsequent decades. In 1966 it was acquired by Saul J. Turell and William Becker, the fathers of the two speakers. Their sons are now co-owners of the Criterion Collection, of which Peter is the president; Jonathan is director of Janus.</p>
<p>To David&#8217;s and my generation of film students, Janus was a key player in our discovery of art cinema. How many of us, I wonder, first watched many of the classics that now grace Criterion DVDs through the landmark PBS series, &#8220;Film Odyssey,&#8221; in 1972? I first saw and was bowled over by <em>Ivan the Terrible</em> in that series. Three years later, when I was working on my dissertation on the film, I called Janus and got through to Saul Turell. Could I possibly borrow 35mm prints of the two parts of the film, I asked, explaining that I needed and to take frames from good copies. He gave me the name and phone number of a person in the company&#8217;s storage facility to call, and she arranged to ship the prints to me. I was able to spend weeks in front of a Steenbeck in the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research, wallowing in strange, beautiful images and sounds. Nearly all the illustrations in my book, <em>Eisenstein&#8217;s <strong>Ivan the Terrible</strong></em>, were taken from those prints.</p>
<p>That same spirit of cooperation with academic film studies has lived on. David and I are grateful for our friendly relationship with the Criterion team, who have cooperated in our <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/03/16/film-art-an-introduction-reaches-a-milestone-with-help-from-the-criterion-collection/" target="_blank">creation of video-based online examples </a>tied to <em>Film Art: An Introduction</em>. (The examples all come from Janus films; a sample analysis of a clip from <em>Vagabond</em> is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwp5aos5FXY" target="_blank">available on YouTube</a>.)</p>
<p>The pair&#8217;s presentation included a video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67UMJojCKxY" target="_blank">The Criterion Collection in 2.5 Minutes</a>. It features over 600 clips from the collection as of September 1, 2012, chosen and edited by Jonathan Keogh, clearly one of the company&#8217;s most devoted fans. Although cut too fast too allow the viewer to identify every title (and I must admit, I don&#8217;t think I could recognize every single one, even with longer excerpts), it&#8217;s an exhilarating paean to great cinema.</p>
<p>The plaudits in the festival&#8217;s annual DVD contest were spread, deliberately or not, among many DVD/Blu-ray companies, with none winning more than one award. A number of items that we&#8217;ve covered here took home awards: Flicker Alley&#8217;s collection of films by the Russian firm in Paris, <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/05/21/albatros-soars/" target="_blank">Albatros</a>, was deemed the best boxed-set of silent films; and Edition Filmmuseum&#8217;s set of <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/11/29/classics-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-in-time-for-a-froliche-weinacht/" target="_blank">four Asta Nielsen films</a> shared the award for best rediscovery. Our friends at the Belgian Cinematek won best Blu-ray boxed set for the <a href="http://www.cinematek.be/?node=30&amp;dvd_id=52&amp;category=5&amp;lng=en" target="_blank">&#8220;Henri Storck Collection.&#8221;</a> Criterion took home best Blu-ray for its edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lonesome-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray-Barbara/dp/B0083V2VZK/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373765568&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lonesome+criterion" target="_blank">Paul Fejos&#8217;s <em>Lonesome</em></a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Return of Carbon Arcs</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Guy-Borlee-and-lamp-housing.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-23914" title="Guy Borlee and lamp housing" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Guy-Borlee-and-lamp-housing.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="465" /></a>I&#8217;m old enough to remember when carbon-arc projectors were the norm. Gradually xenon lamps replaced them, starting in 1956. This year, the festival put on two outdoor screenings in the courtyard of the Cineteca&#8217;s building. These started at 10 pm, so they competed with the bigger shows in the Piazza Maggiore. I usually don&#8217;t go to the Piazza screenings, since they tend to end late, and I don&#8217;t want to fall asleep during the 9 am screenings the next day. But the two programs, billed as &#8220;Il Cinema ambulante Ritrovato. Tesori dal Fondo Morieux,&#8221; were considerably shorter, so I attended the first one. As the name suggests, the idea was to simulate a traveling cinema of the early era. The first screenings included one Pathé film from 1904 and five others from 1906, some with hand-stenciled color. All six were rediscovered titles.</p>
<p>They came from the remarkable 2006 find of a wealth of films, equipment, posters, and even sets and puppets, in a warehouse in Belgium. The collection all originated from the stock of the traveling Théâtre Morieux, which had started with puppet and magic-lantern programs, adding films in 1906. All this material had been in the warehouse for a century and was in good condition.</p>
<p>The projector used for the program was not from 1906, but it was old, and very heavy. I happened to be between films when a truck with a crane delivered the projector and a generator and a team set up the equipment facing a small screen on one side of the courtyard. (At the very top of today&#8217;s entry, the crane lowers the projector body onto its platform. Above, festival coordinator Guy Borlée watches as the lamp housing is attached. Bottom, all ready to go and waiting for the sun to set.) The projector was a Prevost, of French manufacture, I would guess from the 1940s.</p>
<p>When 10 pm arrived, it became apparent that the light from buildings near the Cineteca could not be entirely controlled. Shadows of the trees in the courtyard were cast on the screen, with light patches between them. But traveling cinemas no doubt frequently set up in venues where nearby sounds and other distractions abounded, so we all accepted the light pollution as part of the experience.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most memorable of the films was <em>Cambrioleurs modernes</em> (&#8220;Modern Burglars,&#8221; director unknown, 1904). In some ways it was rather crude, with the set consisting of two large painted house façades facing each other, angled from the front, and a wall beyond them. The acrobatic burglars arrived over the wall to rob one house, propping a long board against an upper window to use as a chute for sliding furniture and other large objects down.</p>
<p>The action becomes faster and more impressively choreographed as police arrive, also over the wall, and give chase. Soon burglars and comic cops are diving through windows and doors in the two buildings, as well as performing comic acrobatics on the chute. The whole thing, as far as I could tell, was done in a single take, though there might have been some invisible cuts. If it was indeed one shot, it was a most impressive piece of staging and performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This &#8216;n&#8217; that</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/laine-des-ferchaux-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23936" title="l'aine des ferchaux 2" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/laine-des-ferchaux-2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="186" /></a></p>
<p>Jean-Pierre Melville&#8217;s 1963 crime/road movie <em>L&#8217;Aîné des Ferchaux</em> (based on a minor Georges Simenon novel) is almost impossible to see on the big screen, apparently due to some sort of rights problem that keeps the French distributor from circulating it. (It is available on a region 2 <a href="http://www.amazon.fr/La%C3%AEn%C3%A9-ferchaux-Jean-Paul-Belmondo/dp/B000N6U1KU/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373767863&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=l%27aine+des+ferchaux" target="_blank">French DVD</a> without subtitles.) The festival managed to show it in the European widescreen thread by borrowing a print from Svenska Filminstitutet, complete with Swedish subtitles. Translations in Italian and English were projected on small screens below the image. I quickly got accustomed to skipping down to the read the third set of subtitles. It&#8217;s certainly not one of Melville&#8217;s masterpieces, but it&#8217;s definitely worth seeing.</p>
<p>The basic premise is that an unscrupulous banker, Dieudonné Ferchaux (veteran French star Charles Vanel), flees arrest by flying from Paris to New York and then setting out toward the South via car. Michel Maudet, an unsuccessful young boxer (Jean-Paul Belmondo), also unscrupulous but so far with no apparent serious crimes to his name, goes along as his secretary. Although the two seem to like each other, Michel becomes increasingly tempted to steal the suitcase stuffed with cash that Ferchaux has picked up in New York, while Ferchaux seems to lose interest in visiting various other places where he has stashed away large sums. The gradual switch in their power relationship furnishes one main line of interest.</p>
<p>The film is also remarkable in that the two stars did not go to the U.S.A. to appear in the considerable amount of landscape footage shot there by a second unit. Instead, they worked in interior sets in France, as well as exteriors that pass for America. Melville managed to stitch these two kinds of footage into a reasonably convincing depiction of an American road trip.</p>
<p>Another film that has long been hard to see outside Italy, at least in its original form, is Rossellini&#8217;s <em>L&#8217;Amore</em> (1948), two contrasting short tales displaying the acting talent of Anna Magnani. The first, <em>Une voca umana</em>, is based on Jean Cocteau&#8217;s <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lamore.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-23939" title="L'amore" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lamore.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="275" /></a>much-adapted short play, <em>La voix humaine.</em> Confined to an apartment, it concentrates on a woman talking on the phone with the lover who has recently left her, trying to convince him that she has adjusted to the break-up while demonstrating through her behavior that she is devastated. Rossellini never places the camera much further back than a plan-américain position, and most of the time the framing displays Magnani&#8217;s face in close-up. Short though it is, it becomes repetitive, and it is too evidently a display of virtuoso acting.</p>
<p>The longer second part, <em>Il Miracolo</em>, is more engaging and original. It is based on an idea by Fellini and a script by Tullio Pinelli and Rossellini. A feeble-minded homeless woman, Nannina, who is tending a herd of goats near a small Italian village, meets a traveler (played by Fellini, left) whom she, being very pious, assumes to be St. Joseph. He offers her wine and, when she falls asleep, rapes her. Learning that she is pregnant, and not realizing what the traveler did, Nannina becomes convinced that she is carrying the baby Jesus. She is teased and hounded by the townspeople. This part of the film led to censorship problems, not because of the sexual content (the rape is simply skipped over and merely implied) but because of the apparent parody of the Immaculate Conception. (This, too, has been available in a mediocre copy without subtitles on an Italian DVD.)</p>
<p>Apart from its innate interest, <em>L&#8217;Amore</em> is historically important for the &#8220;Miracle Decision&#8221; in the U.S., where it was banned for sacrilege. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Burstyn,_Inc_v._Wilson" target="_blank">Supreme Court decision</a> in the case led to the extension of first-amendment protection to cinema.</p>
<p>Il Cinema Ritrovato has become a venue for the exhibition of the latest restorations by Martin Scorsese&#8217;s <a href="http://worldcinemafoundation.org/" target="_blank">World Cinema Foundation</a>. This organization restores films from countries whose archives do not have the means to do such work. Since 2007, the foundation has preserved on average three films a year. This year the items on show at Bologna included Filipino director Lino Brocka&#8217;s <em>Manila in the Claws of Light</em> (1975, also known as <em>Manila in the Claws of Neon</em>). I had never seen a Brocka film (it&#8217;s discussed in a passage of <em>Film History: An Introduction,</em> for which David was responsible), but I was impressed by this one, widely considered to be his best.</p>
<p>It follows a naive young man from the countryside whose girlfriend has become the victim of sex-trafficking; he seeks her in Manila and experiences unfair wage practices and other forms of corruption. Brocka managed to blend seamlessly an absorbing narrative with sympathetic characters and an undercurrent of bitter social critique. Remarkably, Brocka also shot a 22-minute making-of documentary, quite similar to modern DVD supplements, that explains how he created realistic scenes of construction work with a small budget and shooting on location with non-professionals.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Manila-in-the-Claws-of-Light.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23937" title="Manila in the Claws of Light" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Manila-in-the-Claws-of-Light.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Another World Cinema Foundation restoration shown this year is the 1971 classic, <em>Ragbar</em> (<em>Downfall</em>, directed by Bahram Bayzaie). Given the extraordinary burst of creativity that has occurred in Iranian filmmaking since the 1980s, I had high hopes for this. In some ways it resembles more recent classics, most notably in its setting in a school.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ragbar-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23989" title="Ragbar 2" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ragbar-2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="209" /></a></p>
<p>The hero is a misfit who has come to teach at the school and becomes the victim of pranks and taunts by his unruly students. A rumor gets started that he is in love with the older sister of one of the students, and in attempting to scotch the rumor, he falls in love with her. Gradually he comes to understand his students and gain their respect. The film is entertaining, though the slim plot seems dragged out too long. The approach is more like commercial mainstream art cinema than like more recent Iranian films. Culturally it is quite interesting, showing some of the customs of the era shortly before the overthrow of the Shah. Most notably the women wear western-style clothes, and some are unveiled.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I had to miss a third Foundation restoration, Ousmene Sembène&#8217;s early short <em>Borom Sarret </em>(1969).</p>
<p>The World Cinema Foundation screenings are among the high points of Ritrovato, and I look forward to seeing more of them in years to come. Among all the festival&#8217;s restorations of well-known classics (this year <em>Hiroshima mon amour</em>, <em>Richard III</em>, and so on), it was a pleasure to see as well some well-known but hitherto difficult to see films. I hope all three, plus Brocka&#8217;s making-of, are included in a future WCF DVD set. (The first set was issued last year and is available from <a href="http://www.amazon.fr/Coffret-World-Cinema-Foundation-1/dp/B006WQH810/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373771868&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=world+cinema+foundation" target="_blank">amazon.fr</a>.)</p>
<p>Finally, I managed to see a few of the films in the &#8220;War Is Near: 1938-1939&#8243; thread. One was a program of three of Humphrey Jennings&#8217; less familiar documentaries, all from 1939: <em>Spare Time</em>, about how working-class people spend their leisure time; <em>The First Days</em>, on the preparations for war in England after its declaration; and <em>S. S. Ionian</em>, on a cargo ship paying visits to ports of call in the Mediterranean. The first two had the true Jennings touch, looking at everyday events with a fresh, unpretentiously poetic viewpoint. The third was more conventional, aimed at presenting information about the importance of non-military shipping for the war effort. All three films, along with a dozen others, are available on the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0051FBKYO/ref=s9_simh_gw_p74_d0_i1?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=09TZ78TW9YZCA10RYJMZ&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=358549767&amp;pf_rd_i=468294" target="_blank">first volume</a> in the BFI&#8217;s region-free DVD edition of Jennings&#8217; complete films.</p>
<p>I also saw Edmond T. Gréville&#8217;s <em>Menaces</em> (1940). Its story of impending war is what David would call a network narrative, set among the residents of a cheap Parisian hotel&#8211;a sort of low-rent version of <em>Grand Hotel.</em> Although most of the stories are not directly about the war, its threat hovers over them all. Perhaps the stand-out is Prof. Hoffman, a disfigured emigré German war veteran (Erich von Stroheim) who gradually realizes that once war breaks out, he will be an enemy alien in the country he considers home. (The film is available on a region 2, unsubtitled <a href="http://www.amazon.fr/Menaces-Mireille-Balin/dp/B008I196TO/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373931035&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=menaces" target="_blank">French DVD</a>.)</p>
<p><em>Menaces</em> was the last film I saw at this year&#8217;s festival, and now I look forward to being able to report in tandem with David at next year&#8217;s!</p>
<p>Once more we thank the Ritrovato team (especially Marcella Natale), led by Peter von Bagh, Guy Borlée,and  Gian Luca Farinelli, for their visionary achievements. They have changed our conception of what a film festival can be, and they have led us to a deeper and wider appreciation of the glories of cinema.</p>
<p>[July 19: Thanks to Antti Alanen for pointing out that Saul and Jonathan Turell's name has only one r. It's spelled indiscriminately all over the internet with one r or two, so thanks also to Brian Carmody of Criterion for confirming that Turell is correct.]</p>
<p>[July 29: Guy Borlée has kindly sent me links for some of the festival events that have gone online at Vimeo since I posted this entry.

<p><em><strong>Drug War</strong> (2012).</em></p>
<p>DB here:</p>
<p>At first glance,<em> Drug War </em>(2012) seems an unusual film for Johnnie To Kei-fung and his Milkyway Image company to make. For one thing, this Mainland production lacks the surface sheen of To’s Hong Kong projects. Shot in wintry Jinhai, a northern port city, and in the central city of Erzhou, it presents stretches of industrial wasteland and bleak superhighways. As a result, To’s characteristic audacious stylization gives way to a bare-bones look. The saturated palette of <em>The Longest Nite</em> (1998) and <em>A Hero Never Dies</em> (1998) is gone, replaced by metallic grays and frosty blues. Hong Kong heartthrob Louis Koo, rapidly becoming To’s <em>jeune premier</em>, is bluntly deglamorized—first glimpsed spewing foam as he tries to steer his car, then moving through the film with a blistered face and a bandaged nose. The noir-flavored <em>Exiled</em> (2006) made its steamy Macau locales seem exquisitely somber and menacing, but <em>Drug War</em>’s early scenes in a hospital have a mundane, documentary quality. Little in To&#8217;s earlier work prepares us for the grubby scene of drug mules groaning as they shit out plastic pods of dope.</p>
<p>Of course it’s a crime story, the genre in which To and his writer-producer collaborator Wai Ka-fai have gained most acclaim. More specifically, it’s a police procedural, a mode they have worked skillfully with <em>Expect the Unexpected</em> (1999) and <em>Mad Detective</em> (2007). Those, like most cop movies, thread the personal lives of the investigators into the cases they’re running. <em>Drug War</em>, though, gives us no glimpse of the cops off-duty. The result presents our officers as strictly business: no wives, kids, or civilian pals distract them from their mission. In this respect, the film’s closest analogue is probably <em>PTU</em> (2003), but even that showed its patrolling cops in more camaraderie and clashes than we get here.</p>
<p>True, there are brief moments of comradeship, as when Yang offers money to help the cops from Erzhou, and her colleagues chip in. A marvelous shot juxtaposes one cop’s cash with the video stream of the burning bills in the ceremony honoring Timmy’s dead wife and her brothers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cash-400.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23827" title="Cash 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cash-400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="172" /></a></p>
<p>Yet the result humanizes the crooks more than the cops. Timmy mourns his family; we don&#8217;t know if Captain Zhang has one.</p>
<p>The concentration on routine and tactics is due partly to the action’s compressed time frame: the seventy-two hour pursuit of the drug gang permits no rest. In addition, made chiefly for the Mainland audience (with Mainland funding), <em>Drug War</em> was subject to censorship that’s more stringent than that in Hong Kong. It may be that To, Wai, and their screenwriting team were cautious about integrating personal lives into their plot. Exploring the officers’ off-duty frailties and failures might have made censors fret. And of course in the emphasis on selfless officers sacrificing their personal lives sends a positive ideological message.</p>
<p>I think that the film benefits in other ways from skipping what Ross Chen calls <a href="http://www.lovehkfilm.com/review_archives/appendix.htm" target="_blank">“cop soap opera”</a> and focusing relentlessly on the central cat-and-mouse game. Zhang&#8217;s investigation becomes engaging for us thanks to well-honed Milkyway narrative maneuvers: a focus on suspenseful strategies and unexpected countermeasures, the weaving together of various destinies, a fascination with doubling and mirroring, surprising genre tweaks, and unusually laconic signaling of story information. Beneath its drab, almost generic surface and its apparently prosaic account of police procedure, <em>Drug War</em> offers a typically engrossing, off-center Milkyway experience.</p>
<p>And yes, gunfights are involved. But even those are not quite business as usual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Live or die, I’ll be with you</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Timmy-car-400-.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23831" title="Timmy car 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Timmy-car-400-.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="172" /></a></p>
<p>After a prologue in which a vomiting Timmy Choi Tin-ming crashes his car into a restaurant, we see several lines of action converging at a highway tollbooth. A truck driven by two drug-addled men pulls through, followed by two more men in a muddy red sedan. Soon an overheating bus pulls up. Panicking, the drug traffickers inside make a run for it before they’re brought down by highway officers and Captain Zhang Lei, who has been working undercover on the bus. The mules are taken to a hospital—the second convergence point—and there Captain Zhang notices that Timmy, borne by on a gurney, has burns typical of a drug explosion. Zhang and female officer Yang Xiaobei visit the site of Timmy’s crash, where they find his cellphone. Its mysterious call queue launches their investigation.</p>
<p>If you haven’t yet seen the film, I hope that the preceding has whetted your interest. From now on, I’m afraid I must indulge in what we in the trade call <strong>spoilers</strong>.</p>
<p>The tollbooth confrontation, it turns out, is a sting operation by which Zhang can nab the traffickers he has infiltrated. The truckers who pass through at the same time are bringing ingredients for Timmy Choi&#8217;s local meth factory, and the red sedan is carrying cops who’ve been tracking them. When Zhang and Yang find Timmy&#8217;s cellphone, they find dozens of missed calls from the truck drivers, and this enables them to connect Timmy with the shipment. His lab has exploded, killing his wife and her brothers. He escaped but suffered the burns and nausea we saw at the outset.</p>
<p>To escape the death penalty Timmy offers to turn snitch. The rest of the film will intercut among various lines of action: the truckers and their pursuers, the cops using CCTV cameras to track the crooks, and Zhang’s efforts to use Timmy to infiltrate the ring. Zhang’s strategy takes him up the chain of command. There is the laughing Jinhai smuggler HaHa and his wife, who are trying to become drug distributors by means of the port they control. They are wooing the cokehead Li Suchang, his superior Uncle Bill Li, and the real bosses, a Hong Kong gang headed by Fatso (Milkyway regular Lam Suet). Timmy, who knows them all, is positioned as go-between. As with many Hong Kong films, a hierarchy of villains permits a cascade of  meetings, showdowns, chases, and chance encounters. Through it all, the question persists: Can Zhang trust Timmy to stay bought?</p>
<p>The first third of the film centers on Zhang’s daring scheme to penetrate the gang. Since HaHa and Li Suchang (called Chang in the English subtitles) have never seen one another, he forces Timmy to set up two meetings. The meetings are timed so that Zhang can impersonate Li in the first meeting and then play HaHa in the second. The result is a pair of virtuoso scenes I’ll go into shortly.</p>
<p>The central chunk of the film follows Timmy’s efforts to get a fresh load of dope for Zhang’s deal. His source is another of his factories, this one staffed by a family of deaf-mutes (a typically perverse Milkyway genre tweak). This section culminates in two intercut police raids: one, a painless seizure of HaHa and his wife, the other a bloody shootout in the factory. The two mutes in charge escape through a hidden passageway, a ploy that renews Zhang’s distrust of Timmy. Timmy vows that he didn’t know about the escape hatch.</p>
<p>The film’s final third introduces the Hong Kong gang directing Uncle Bill from behind the scenes. The film’s first two sections have emphasized the cops’ ability to track the gang with public surveillance cameras and minicams secreted in hotel suites and in the meth warehouse. Now we learn that the gang has its own technology. Hidden microphones and wireless recorders allow gang members to listen to conversations. Fatso feeds dialogue to Uncle Bill in his negotations with Zhang/HaHa. In their final rendezvous at a nightclub, Zhang discovers the ruse and uses it as an excuse to finalize the deal. But when the Hong Kongers demand a night out just for themselves, Captain Zhang must let Timmy go off with them and trust him to deliver them to him the next day.</p>
<p>Timmy betrays everyone. At the climax all the forces in play converge once more, this time outside a primary school. Cars bearing police surround the vehicles carrying the gang. Even the truckers are summoned by Timmy, and eventually the deaf-mutes show up too. Timmy tears off the wire he’s wearing, tells the gang that it&#8217;s an ambush, and launches an all-out firefight. While cops and crooks blast each other, Timmy slips into a school bus to hide from the barrage.</p>
<p>The gang is cut down, but so too are the police, including Yang. Even our protagonist Zhang is fatally wounded. Hong Kong aficionados will find here echoes of the pitiless climax of another Milkyway <em>policier</em> I probably should not specify.</p>
<p>The film’s epilogue, like the prologue, centers on Timmy <em>in extremis</em>. In prison he’s strapped down for lethal injection and babbling the name of every dealer he knows, hoping somehow to save himself from execution. He fails.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most memorable image in the film’s final moments comes a bit earlier, at the end of the gun battle. Timmy brutally finishes off Captain Zhang, only to discover that Zhang has handcuffed his wrist to Timmy’s ankle. Timmy is captured frantically dragging Zhang’s corpse around the street, fulfilling Zhang’s warning after the ill-fated factory raid: “Live or die, I’ll be with you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Playing parts</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Teapot-400.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23820" title="Teapot 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Teapot-400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="170" /></a></p>
<p>Within this broad movement toward giving Timmy his punishment, at horrendous cost to the forces of law, To and Wai have built fine-grained scenes that swerve the conventions of cop movies in typical Milkway directions. The chief example involves large-scale repetition. During the first section, Zhang goes undercover, pretending to be a gang member. The subterfuge is given a twist: Zhang impersonates Li Suchang in his meeting with HaHa, then he impersonates HaHa in his meeting with Suchang. Once more a Milkyway film finds tricky drama in symmetry and doubling.</p>
<p>The first impersonation goes more easily, but it gets a healthy dose of suspense. Zhang plays Li Suchang as a cold, impassive negotiator. He barely speaks in response to HaHa, who lives up to his name by supplying a stream of chatter and guffaws. He’s not as dense as he might appear, but Zhang has little trouble intimidating him. The problem is that the mini video camera hidden in Zhang/Li’s cigar case is first blocked by food on the table and then arouses the curiosity of HaHa. The tension rises as HaHa examines the case, but Timmy nonchalantly rescues it. His intervention reinforces our sense, in this stretch of the film, that he is cooperating smoothly with the police sting.</p>
<p>Once the charade is over, the film’s narration increases the suspense by the tight timing of the next meeting, which takes place only minutes after the first. Zhang and Yang, who will be playing HaHa’s wife, must change clothes swiftly and prepare cameras to record the deal. The real Li Suchang goes upstairs with Zhang and Timmy just as the real HaHa and wife saunter out of the other elevator: The shot sums up the charade Zhang has engineered, as well as the plot&#8217;s mirror structure.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Elevators-400.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23803" title="Elevators 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Elevators-400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="169" /></a></p>
<p>The second encounter ratchets up the tension. Zhang and Yang imitate HaHa and his wife, whom they’ve watched moments earlier; they even repeat lines spoken by the real couple in the previous scene. But Li Suchang is a more aggressive bargainer than HaHa and offers Zhang/HaHa some cocaine. The real HaHa claimed never to have touched the drug, so Zhang/HaHa declines. But Li insists, so the policeman must snort a line. This induces a good deal of uneasiness, which is upped when Li insists he take another hit. Zhang/HaHa obliges and becomes woozy. When Li demands that he snort a third line, Timmy again intervenes and asks that they proceed with the deal. Li relents and they make an appointment with Uncle Bill.</p>
<p>After Li Suchang leaves, there follows a chilling scene in which Zhang goes into drug shock, collapsing to the floor and twitching frantically. Timmy explains what the other cops must do to save him, and by following his commands they revive Zhang. Again Timmy seems firmly on the side of the police. But Zhang still wonders: Did Timmy secretly signal to Li? His mistrust will expand when the deaf-mute factory workers elude the police through an exit that Timmy didn’t mention.</p>
<p>The motif of doubling, a To/Wai staple, runs through the movie: two truckers, two cops tailing them, two deaf-mute killers, two raids, two traffic encounters with the gang, two times that Zhang must trust Tommy and release him. Even the climax consists of not one but two gun battles, the first in front of the school, the second in a nearby street. But the scenes in which Zhang plays both parties in a drug deal is the most audacious instance, and a fine example of Milkyway’s gift for reimagining basic conventions of the crime film.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Milkyway’s rule of one</strong></p>
<p>In <em>Planet Hong Kong 2.0</em>, as well as in my discussion of <em>Mad Detective</em> <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/essays/maddetective.php" target="_blank">on this site</a>, I suggest that despite all this obsessive doubling, Milkyway films tend to refuse the redundancy that crime movies usually demand.</p>
<p>One instance is the gradual revelation that in the opening, the bus overheating at the toll booth is part of a police trap. Not only is Zhang aboard (sporting a Stetson), but the ticket taker is Officer Yang and the driver (merely glimpsed) is one of Zhang&#8217;s men. Since the incident isn&#8217;t referred to as a sting afterward, we must realize on our own that this sequence furnishes an abrupt introduciton to the police unit&#8217;s efficiency and farsightedness.</p>
<p>Another instance is a little less cryptic but has longer-term consequences. The police are preparing for the double masquerade, and Zhang lets Timmy pick out appropriate outfits for them to wear. In a scene lasting only forty-five seconds and ten shots, the emphasis is on Timmy’s careful selection of suits—presented, as we might expect, in imagery of pairing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/suits-1a-400.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23822" title="suits 1a 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/suits-1a-400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="172" /></a>     <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/suits-2-400.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23823" title="suits 2 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/suits-2-400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="172" /></a></p>
<p>While this preparation is going forward, To inserts a shot of hands crushing aspirin tablets into powder.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spoon-1-400-.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23824" title="Spoon 1 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spoon-1-400-.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="172" /></a></p>
<p>Later we see that Officer Yang is filling a flask with the powdered aspirin.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spoon-2-400.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23825" title="Spoon 2 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spoon-2-400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="172" /></a></p>
<p>What’s going on here? Another sort of film would have inserted dialogue something like this: <em>HaHa hasn’t met Li Suchang, but he’s probably heard that he’s a druggie. He’ll expect me to use coke. If he offers, I’ll tell him that I use only my own. We’ll prepare some fake stuff for me to bring in a flask. </em>And this would have been a clear setup for what will in fact happen in the first meeting. But we don’t get such a setup. Moreover, at this point Yang’s action is even more cryptic because we don’t yet know about Suchang’s addiction, which Zhang is planning to mimic. Yang is preparing a protective measure against a threat we will only learn of later.</p>
<p>The Milkyway writing team often treats story points in this peremptory way. If <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/12/17/a-dose-of-dos-trade-secrets-from-selznick/" target="_blank">the Hollywood rule</a> is “Tell the audience every major point three times,” To and Wai often assume that one mention is enough, and even that can come before we’re in a position to appreciate it. Indeed, Zhang’s scam depends completely on the fact that HaHa and Suchang have never met, but that premise is told us on only one occasion, and it’s not given much emphasis.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Timmy-1-400.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23810" title="Timmy 1 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Timmy-1-400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="168" /></a>     <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Timmy-2-4002.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23813" title="Timmy 2 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Timmy-2-4002.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="168" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Timmy-3-4001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23875" title="Timmy 3 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Timmy-3-4001.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="172" /></a></p>
<p>Again, we could play Hollywood scriptwriters and let Zhang and Yang huddle to explain how they will exploit the fact that the two gangsters can’t recognize each other. But the Milkyway team skips all that. The plan is devised offscreen. We next see Zhang and Timmy picking their wardrobe and Yang preparing the phony cocaine.</p>
<p>In the prologue, we have gotten another roundabout piece of foreshadowing. As Timmy’s car careens down the street, a single shot is presented as the view of a surveillance camera.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/video-car-400.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23832" title="video car 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/video-car-400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="172" /></a></p>
<p>A more orthodox film would then cut to a Network Operations Center where concerned officials are watching traffic. But To simply cuts back to the car, where Timmy&#8217;s cellphone falls to the floor. Only after Timmy becomes a person of interest to the police do we see investigators re-running CCTV footage of the car. The one video shot has been a hint about how the police will build up their knowledge of Timmy. More broadly, it prefigures the importance of police video surveillance of the gang throughout the film.</p>
<p>Most laconic of all, I think, is the rather complicated scene taking place at a traffic light. The transfer of an important valise, containing money or drugs, is one of the most hoary conventions of the cop thriller. Director To makes it the occasion of a crisscrossing geometry and barely noticeable hints about Timmy&#8217;s ultimate aims.</p>
<p>Waiting at the light on the way to a meeting, Zhang as HaHa gets a call from Suchang and Uncle Bill, in a Mercedes sedan waiting behind them. There&#8217;ll be no meeting; a deal will be done right here. Zhang’s team is spread out in other vehicles backed up at the light.</p>
<p>But when Zhang as HaHa picks up a parcel to deliver to a white van further along the line of cars, To’s camera coasts rightward to show a dark van waiting in the next lane. We aren’t shown who’s in it. Soon, as Zhang transfers the bag to the van, we see yet another vehicle at the front of the line, and over his shoulder we see a woman inside.</p>

<p>Cut to inside that vehicle, where the woman, the driver, and a fat man in the back seat sit impassively.</p>

<p>Within the plot, the scene functions as Bill Li&#8217;s effort to determine whether he&#8217;s being set up. The transfer turns out to be a fake, aiming to confirm that Timmy has not turned snitch. If his associates are undercover cops, they are likely to reveal themselves here in order to make a bust. That would fail, because the bag Zhang ends up with carries only imported cigars.</p>
<p>Beyond its function as a test, the traffic stop plays a crucial narrational role. Through mere glimpses and without anything being prepared for, we&#8217;re introduced to the Hong Kong gang that will play a commanding role in the last third of the film. The subterfuge is that we haven&#8217;t yet been told that there <em>is</em> such a gang; at this point, they are simply oddly emphasized passengers in adjacent vehicles. A more traditional plot would have included an earlier scene in which the police identify the Hong Kong suspects and provide their backstory. Then, seeing them at the intersection would satisfy us that we were putting the story together. Instead, working with almost no dialogue, using the traffic backup as another convergence point, To and Wai have evoked a strange uneasiness. Who are these people, and why are we seeing them?</p>
<p>Immediately after these shots of adjacent vehicles, another dark van opens and a passenger sets a carrying case on the street. Yang in her guise of HaHa’s wife fetches that case. Then, in a slippery set of POV shots, Timmy turns and looks back at other men in vehicles, and then at Uncle Bill and Li Suchang, who seem to evade his stare.</p>

<p>Why dwell on Timmy at the height of the scene? For the first time we can study his reactions when his captors aren&#8217;t watching him. His calculating stare suggests that he knows, well before the police do, that the deal is a sham. He realizes that if the cops do take the bait and reveal themselves, only he will pay the price. Now he knows that he can&#8217;t count on the gang and that he&#8217;s on his own. At the climax he&#8217;ll take his revenge on both sides by halting the motorcade before it reaches the port, where cops are poised to arrest the gang. That will provoke the final shootout—which, like this scene, involves all the principals confronting one another in vehicles on the street.</p>
<p>This is a lot to load onto a brief, silent exchange of looks, but it&#8217;s typical of To and Wai&#8217;s glancing exposition. Another director would have provided stronger clues to what&#8217;s going on in Timmy&#8217;s mind, perhaps through flashbacks or voice-over. Yet that tactic would depend on our knowing who the people in the other cars are. Only later, before the meeting at HaHa&#8217;s port, will Timmy identify them. He will spill this information very quickly. And just once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since its founding in 1996, Milkyway Image has responded adroitly to changes in the regional film industry. For their local audience, To and Wai have created popular comedies, off-kilter thrillers, and unclassifiable items like <em>Running on Karma</em> (2003) and <em>Throw Down</em> (2004). They have occasionally completed coproductions with Europe (<em>Vengeance</em>, 2009) and an Asian branch of Hollywood (<em>Turn Left, Turn Right</em>, 2003). They have adjusted to the soaring Mainland market, even revising <em>Breaking News</em> (2004) to suit the censors. Just as a string of Milkyway romantic comedies yielded some financial stability in the 2000s Hong Kong market, more recent efforts like <em>Don’t Go Breaking My Heart</em> (2011) and <em>Romancing in Thin Air</em> (2012) have given the company a foothold in the PRC.</p>
<p>Yet Milkyway takes chances too. <em>Election 2</em> (2006) surprised everyone with its bold acknowledgement of Triad networks on the Mainland; neither it nor its predecessor was shown theatrically there. <em>Drug War </em>has attracted notice among international critics for its frank treatment of the PRC underworld. To and Wai seem to find unusual opportunities in every project. Here, making Hong Kong gangsters the ultimate villains suggests that the pestilence comes primarily from elsewhere. At the same time, giving Timmy and the Hong Kong gang such prominence permits casting some of the Milkyway repertory company, familiar actors not only in Hong Kong and the Mainland but also in the international market.</p>
<p>Johnnie To, it seems, can zigzag his way to creative achievement in different circumstances. He and Wai are keeping Hong Kong cinema alive in unpromising times and finding new narrative resources in a genre that often seems played out. Their latest, <em>Blind Detective</em> (2013), is receiving pretty unfavorable notices, but this long, preposterous semi-comedy is, I expect, another symptom of the sidewinding strategy that characterizes their work.</p>
<p>With Milkyway, adventurous exploration of cinema is also a business plan. Catch them if you can.</p>

<p><em>Drug War</em> <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/hongkong/?yr=2013&amp;wk=19&amp;p=.htm" target="_blank">performed sturdily</a> at the Hong Kong box office (over US $600,000) but <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/china/?yr=2013&amp;wk=17&amp;p=.htm" target="_blank">did really well in China</a>, garnering upward of $23 million during its April release. <a href="http://www.indiewire.com/article/drug-war" target="_blank">Well Go and Variance</a> open <em>Drug War</em> on 26 July for a US theatrical run. Before that it’s playing several festivals, including <a href="http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiffbelllightbox/2013/2330020385" target="_blank">the mammoth TIFF Chinese series on 14 July</a>. Mr. To will introduce the TIFF screening. The day before, 13 July, he will be present for <a href="http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiffbelllightbox/2013/2550008195" target="_blank">a conversation</a>.</p>
<p>Milkyway plots often rely on converging destinies, of character trajectories intersecting through chance. This principle is less pronounced in <em>Drug War</em>, except for the moments when the two truckers and the two deaf-mutes unexpectedly hook into the main plotline. Accidental convergence, often pointing up parallels among the characters, is clearer in <em>A Hero Never Dies</em> (1998) and <em>Life without Principle</em> (2011). I discuss the first film in <em>Planet Hong Kong 2.0</em>, the other <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2011/10/09/principle-with-interest/" target="_blank">in this entry</a>.</p>
<p><strong>P.S. later 8 June: </strong>Today you get double value. <a href="http://www.gradyhendrix.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Grady Hendrix</strong></a>, Hong Kong film expert and one force behind <a href="http://subwaycinemanews.com/" target="_blank">Subway Cinema</a>, writes with this thoughtful interpretation of <em>Drug War</em>&#8211;which makes it seem as daring thematically as it is in its narrative strategies.</p>
<p><strong>For me, the most interesting element is the long game that I think To and Wai are playing and what I see as the secret heart of the movie. I think that the meaning of the film isn&#8217;t conveyed so much by the narrative as by the tools used to create the narrative: the actors. All of the cops are Mainland actors, most of the drug dealers are Hong Kong actors. What are drug dealers besides capitalism run amuck, completely unregulated? What are cops but authoritarian impulses, completely unregulated? The two groups have similar goals: make money at all costs; catch the criminals at all costs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The cops in the film are China personified: they have unlimited resources, massive numbers, infinite organization, but they are heartless towards outsiders, unforgiving, and they don&#8217;t trust anyone. The criminals are all the stereotypes of Hong Kong-ers: they are family, they are stylish and chic, they eat meals together (Hong Kong people love to eat, after all) but they are only interested in money. They will save themselves and leave their wives to die, they will betray anyone (including their uncle and godfather), to make a buck. Both groups use the same tools, but they are opposites: unregulated capitalism vs. unregulated authoritarianism; the unstoppable object and the immovable force.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The fact that when put into conflict these two forces destroy each other is, I think, a critique of both Hong Kong and the Mainland, and I think To and Wai want to show how each has gone too far and both have become merciless and inhuman. Of course, in the end, China wins out and Hong Kong&#8217;s biggest pop star is on a table whimpering as China slips in the needle (which is weird, since I don&#8217;t think China uses lethal injection to execute people, but then again it&#8217;s an instance of Chinese drugs beating Hong Kong&#8217;s drugs). </strong></p>
<p>Thanks to Grady for opening up this aspect of the film! And I&#8217;m sure the packed house that greeted <em>Drug War</em> during <a href="http://subwaycinema.com/nyaff13/drug-war/#more-348" target="_blank">its screening</a> at <a href="http://subwaycinema.com/nyaff13/" target="_blank">the New York Asian Film Festival</a> thank him and his colleagues too.</p>

<p><em><strong>Martial Club</strong> (1981, Lau Kar-leung).</em></p>
<p>“It’s too late. We don’t need stuntmen any more. We have computers.”</p>
<p>Lau Kar-leung</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DB here:</p>
<p><a href="http://hkmdb.com/db/people/view.mhtml?id=4121&amp;display_set=eng" target="_blank">Lau Kar-leung</a> (in Mandarin: Liu Chia-liang), who <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hong-kong-director-lau-kar-574372" target="_blank">died last week</a>, was one of the best filmmakers of the 1970s and 1980s. Yet he remains largely unknown in the west.</p>
<p>Why? He made Hong Kong martial-arts movies, a genre long despised by upscale cinephiles. His career took off after the kung-fu boom in America and Europe had ended, so his films didn’t get wide circulation abroad. Worse, he worked for Shaw Bros., the studio decried as a soulless movie factory. (Oddly, his best films coincided with the decline of the studio’s output, as Run Run Shaw turned his attention more to television.) In Asia Lau’s films had to compete with the rising popularity of Golden Harvest’s fast, slick new films starring the Hui brothers, Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao, and Jackie Chan. And he largely missed the shift to the modern urban action picture that helped Hong Kong films into world markets in the late 1980s. Even though he made the remarkable cop movie <em>Tiger on the Beat</em> (1988), he never fully embraced the bloody-brotherhood ethos epitomized in the work of John Woo.</p>
<p>Before he became a director, Lau was a martial-arts choreographer. Credits list him on over 125 films, though he claimed to have worked on more than two hundred. He came into his own as an action choreographer in 1962, when he was about twenty-five. He worked for companies turning out both Cantonese and Mandarin martial-arts films. The film that brought him to attention was <em>The Jade Bow</em> (1966), made for the Great Wall company. This rattling effort, choreographed by Lau and his frequent collaborator Tong Kai, made ingenious use of wirework and reverse-motion effects.</p>
<p><em>The Jade Bow</em>, hard and spare in its style, was strikingly similar to the new wave of martial arts films announced with great fanfare by the Shaws studios in the same year. Soon Lau became a major Shaws choreographer. Usually paired with Tong, he collaborated on many of Chang Cheh’s flamboyant, aggressive action pictures, including <em>The Assassin</em> (1967), <em>One-Armed Swordsman</em> (1967), <em>Golden Swallow</em> (1968), <em>New One-Armed Swordsman</em> (1970), <em>Blood Brothers</em> (1973), and <em>Disciples of Shaolin</em> (1975). Lau might stage fights for sixteen different releases in a single year.</p>
<p>Lau and Tong complemented one another. Lau grew up in a martial-arts household and learned classic technique from his father. Tong came from Cantonese opera, eventually working as a stage stuntman. To his film work Tong brought acrobatic styles and a deep knowledge of weaponry that helped him design eye-catching swords and spears. The two worked out fights together, one playing the protagonist, the other the antagonist. In 1975, Lau became a director while Tong continued to choreograph other projects.</p>
<p>Lau began directing just as the kung-fu boom needed something to spice it up. Bruce Lee had introduced serious, even melodramatic combat. Chang Cheh had continued in this vein while emphasizing agonizing violence, homorerotic tensions, and plots based on Shaolin temple legends. Soon Chang would innovate along a different dimension by presenting circus-like, almost camp extravaganzas centered on the Five Deadly Venoms team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A dash, or more, of laughs</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/dirto-ho-400.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23777" title="dirto ho 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/dirto-ho-400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="172" /></a></p>
<p>Lau’s directorial debut, <em>The Spiritual Boxer</em> (1975), is often considered the first kung-fu comedy, and many of his films include mugging, goofy dialogue, and physical gags. He went beyond one-off humor by finding ways to make combat itself funny. In <em>Dirty Ho</em> (1979) two masters maintain teatime manners while trying to thrust goblets, fans, and fingers into each other&#8217;s face (above). <em>My Young Auntie</em> (1981) features a demure heroine who is, to everyone’s surprise, an adept at kung-fu. <em>Heroes of the East</em> (1978; my preferred title: <em>Shaolin vs. Ninja</em>) rests entirely on a comic premise. A Chinese man marries a Japanese woman, but soon they quarrel about which nation has the stronger warrior tradition. Broken furniture follows. Even <em>Legendary Weapons of China</em> (1982), an attempt to present the Boxer Rebellion, can’t avoid spectacular gag scenes in which a magic doll is twisted  to manipulate a fighter into grotesque positions.</p>
<p>Lau’s emblematic actor, as central to him as John Wayne was to Ford or James Stewart was to Anthony Mann, was Lau Kar-fai (Liu Chia-hui), familiarly known in Western circles as Gordon Liu. Sometimes bald, sometimes bearded or mustached, Liu can play hayseed, shirker, reluctant hero, con man, or elder sage. His breakout role came in one of Kar-fai’s most famous films, <em>36 Chambers of Shaolin</em> (1978), which was given a comic sequel as <em>Return to the 36<sup>th</sup> Chamber</em> (1980). But there’s nothing funny about the ferocity of <em>The 8-Diagram Pole Fighter</em> (1984), which begins with a theatrically abstract representation of a battle and ends with Gordon Liu rescued by monks who bash in the teeth of their adversaries.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/8-diagram-400.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23769" title="8 diagram 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/8-diagram-400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="170" /></a></p>
<p>Liu brought to the action genre a fierce athleticism, a tireless energy—some of his films contain a dozen combats, big and small—and a thorough acquaintance with many martial-arts schools. A film might showcase one fighting style or several. At the climax of <em>Legendary Weapons</em> Lau himself steps in to perform virtuoso moves with a variety of spears, chain whips, daggers, swords, and staffs. <em>Heroes of the East</em> sets seven Japanese masters, each with a martial specialty, against our young Chinese husband, and the film provides virtually a compare-contrast essay in Asian combat tactics. Sometimes one thinks that Lau was aiming at nothing less than a filmic encyclopedia of classic martial arts, a sort of audiovisual database of the entire Chinese <em>wuxia</em> tradition.</p>
<p>This shouldn’t be taken to mean that his filming was straightforward. Lau had tremendous cinematic gifts. Staccato figure movement, often integrated with punchy zooms, give his scenes a racy, infectious pulse. Although he usually stays far enough back to capture the entire action, he cuts very fast, averaging four to five seconds, but his careful &#8216;Scope compositions and smooth match cuts keep the action intelligible. The frame teems with movement. A pole may jab into the foreground, and his fighters may pop up from the bottom or sides of the frame. Starting from a detail, a zoom-back can create a whooshing burst in the manner of a comic-strip splash panel. These conventions of local cinema were made especially gripping by their integration with the distinctive maneuvers of each fighting mode.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong tradition relies on rhythmic staging and cutting, but Lau took things further than most. Even in scenes not centered on combats, he found ways to make movements counter each other, cut for cut, or to flow from one figure to another across the scene. Motion often becomes contagious, with one man’s gesture followed by another man’s rhyming head turn or sudden twist of a torso. Fighters prowling in a darkened attic in <em>Legendary Weapons</em> are intercut with their target in the floor below; his abrupt gestures and pauses are echoed by theirs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Leg-weapons-1-300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23779" title="Leg weapons 1 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Leg-weapons-1-300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="130" /></a>     <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Leg-weapons-2300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23780" title="Leg weapons 2300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Leg-weapons-2300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="130" /></a></p>
<p>Once Lau found his stride, he seemed to make every film an experiment in rendering kung-fu’s most esoteric traditions through the resources of purely cinematic rhythm.</p>
<p>His most sustained output ran from 1975 to 1985, although he directed sporadically thereafter. His last directed film, <em>Drunken Monkey</em> (2003), failed to attract attention, but he remained the honored elder consulted by younger directors. Jackie Chan engaged him for his <em>Drunken Master</em> <em>II</em> (1994) and Tsui Hark hired him for <em>Seven Swords</em> (2005).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let’s get unreal</strong></p>
<p>Almost always, I tend to think, the quest for realism in cinema is misguided. Realism is often just an alibi for the brand of artifice we prefer. The great “realist” movements in cinema did access certain aspects of the world that were overlooked by other trends, but they treated those aspects through new conventions. From Soviet Socialist Realism through postwar American “semidocumentary” shooting and Method acting to Neorealism and onward, fresh forms replaced, or reworked exisiting ones. Reality is multifaceted, and any style can be said to be faithful to some facets of it.</p>
<p>It might be nice if our filmmakers working outside the realm of comedy acknowledged artifice more frankly. Today, watching the “realistic” action scenes of <em>World War Z</em> and others like it, with their choppy cutting, murky staging, and grab-and-go framing, I’m reminded not of their excuse (to render &#8220;the way characters feel&#8221;) but of their overarching purpose: to obtain a PG-13 rating. The new conventions aim to hide the action rather than display it.</p>
<p>That demand keeps many of today’s action films from being precisely and percussively arousing. We’re supposed to be satisfied with a vague excitement. Our films project a manic, diffuse busyness, an effort to suggest lots going on without ever specifying exactly what it feels like to run, to fall, to hit a wall, to feel a blow—in short, to face the stubborn physicality of the world. Those effects can, paradoxically enough, often be best activated by highly stylized cinema.</p>
<p>Consider the chainsaw climax of Lau’s <em>Tiger on the Beat</em>, which I’ve analyzed <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2011/01/14/planet-hong-kong-the-dragon-dances/" target="_blank">in an earlier entry</a>. Even in this YouTube video, it retains a lot of its impact.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/v8_dY4rpjOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Yes, it’s over the top. Yes, it employs Hong Kong Physics. No, it wouldn&#8217;t get a PG-13. But every image and sound is focused to achieve crisp excitement. It&#8217;s very fast without being confusing. The use of film technique is cogent, inventive (how many ways to wreck a paint shop?), and stirring. And a little funny too.</p>
<p>It’s not realistic, but it knocks you upside the head. You either laugh or gape, but you can’t say you felt nothing. Stylization, in other words, is one path to powerful expression, and even exhilaration. Nobody understood that better than Lau Kar-leung.</p>

Thanks also to Ross Chen of <a href="http://www.lovehkfilm.com/index.htm" target="_blank">Lovehkfilm</a>, a great source of news and reviews, for his many years of friendship and his dedication to the cause.</p>
<p>Gordon Liu (Lau Kar-fai) is often spoken of as Lau Kar-leung&#8217;s brother. Actually, they are not blood relations. Gordon was the godson of Lau&#8217;s father, and he was trained in martial arts by Lau Kar-leung. Thanks to Li Cheuk-to for help in clarifying this.</p>
<p>We owe a debt to <a href="http://www.celestialpictures.com/co-shaw.asp" target="_blank">Celestial Pictures</a>, the company that acquired and remastered the classic Shaw films in mammoth quantities. Apart from the tweeting birds that seep into too many soundtracks, the restorations have been gorgeous and allow us to rediscover films that for decades were virtually impossible to see.</p>

<p>Of recent Hollywood action films the one I&#8217;ve seen that comes closest to the Hong Kong aesthetic is Steven Soderbergh&#8217;s <em>Haywire</em>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Mildred Pierce</strong> (1945).</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DB here:</p>
<p>At the climax of <em>Now You See Me</em>, a barrage of brief shots skips back in time to show how our quartet of magicians pulled off the complicated illusion we’ve just seen. (A very, very complicated illusion, in fact. You and I should be so lucky.) Soon our Four Horsemen come to realize that a puppetmaster behind the scenes has been steering them, and this awareness comes in another flurry of flashbacks.</p>
<p>Today’s movies are constantly using fragmentary flashbacks to fill in elements left out of earlier scenes. I recently considered <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/03/24/side-effects-and-safe-haven-out-of-the-past/" target="_blank">how <em>Safe Haven</em> and <em>Side Effects</em> use the convention</a>, but lots of other films will furnish examples. Crucial to this technique is an illusion created by cinematic narration. The first time through a scene, we think we’re seeing everything. But the replay shows us bits and pieces that were left out, or that we didn’t notice, or that we’ve forgotten about.</p>
<p>Back in 1992 I wrote an essay about this technique. &#8220;Cognition and Comprehension: Viewing and Forgetting in <em>Mildred Pierce</em>&#8221; focuses on the murder of Monte Beragon in the 1945 film. A revised version of the essay appears in <em>Poetics of Cinema</em> and <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/books/poetics.php" target="_blank">is now available on this website</a>. The piece tries to show that a cognitive approach to comprehension and recollection can explain how a film shapes viewers&#8217; responses—in this case, creating mystery while making viewers forget certain things they’ve seen.</p>
<p>Today I’m going to consider <em>Mildred</em> again, but by doing something I couldn’t do in print. The wonders of the Internetz let me use video extracts to show concretely how clever this replay is. I frame my case here differently than in the earlier piece, although there are ideas and examples common to both. Perhaps what I do here will tease you into reading the more technical essay.</p>
<p>And of course there are <strong>spoilers</strong>—most thoroughly in reference to <em>Mildred</em>, more mildly in reference to <em>Side Effects</em> and <em>The Unfaithful</em> (1947).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hiding murder</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Monte-mirror-400.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23621" title="Monte mirror 400" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Monte-mirror-400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>At the start of <em>Mildred Pierce</em> we see Monte shot down in a beach house, but we don’t see who did it. At the climax of the film, we’ll see a flashback replay the murder, filling in elements that were suppressed in the earlier version. In these sequences, director Michael Curtiz and the film’s screenwriters make choices about at least three narrative conventions.</p>
<p>How do you present the original scene? How do you handle the flashback? How do you present the replay?</p>
<p>These choices confront every screenwriter or director who wants the <em>Aha!</em> effect of dramatically revealing what was really happening in an earlier sequence.</p>
<p>The filmmakers’ decisions will be shaped by the urge to make the audience’s pickup fast and effortless. The filmmakers know that we tend to want to cut to the core of a story situation, to grab its gist and move on, and we trust that the film’s unfolding will help us do that. But this very speed can work against us. By counting on our knowledge of conventions, filmmmakers can encourage us to jump to conclusions that will turn out to be inaccurate.</p>
<p>Start with the handling of <strong>the original scene</strong>. Your choices are basically these: We can see the action fully, or we can see it only partially, with some aspects suppressed. Consider the opening of <em>The Letter</em> (1940). Leslie Crosbie strides out of a cottage, blasting away at a man who tries to crawl away from her.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/4.2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23620" title="4.2" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/4.2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>We see the crime fully, so the mystery involves circumstances. What led up to this murder? The rest of the film’s plot will concentrate on that.</p>
<p>Alternatively, some element of the initial scene can be omitted. This is what we get in the shooting of Miles Archer near the start of <em>The Maltese Falcon</em> (1941).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Archer-shot-300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23618" title="Archer shot 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Archer-shot-300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" /></a></p>
<p>It’s familiar territory. The film’s narration conceals the identity of the killer by framing him or her out of the shot. The question of who killed Archer will propel part of the action to come.</p>
<p>The crucial action can be suppressed even more thoroughly. In <em>The Accused</em> (1947), a woman is followed into her home. We already know her as a wealthy wife waiting for her husband to come home, but we aren’t shown the identity of the shadowy male figure who grabs her and forces his way into the house.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unfaithful-1-300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23613" title="Unfaithful 1 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unfaithful-1-300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" /></a>     <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unfaithful-2-300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23614" title="Unfaithful 2 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unfaithful-2-300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" /></a></p>
<p>And the camera stays obstinately outside while someone is shot in the house.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unfaithful-3-300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23615" title="Unfaithful 3 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unfaithful-3-300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" /></a></p>
<p>Only later will we find out who the victim is, and the entire film will slowly reveal what really happened inside, and what led up to it.</p>
<p>I’ll have some things to say about <em>Mildred</em>’s initial murder scene shortly, but now let’s consider the second key convention: <strong>the flashback device</strong> itself. What is a flashback? Most basically, it involves presenting earlier story events in the midst of later ones. It’s often motivated as a memory, as when a woman recalls her childhood. But there doesn’t have to be a memory motivation; the film’s narration can directly show us bits of action that occurred in the past (as in the “objective” flashbacks in Kubrick’s <em>The Killing</em>).</p>
<p><em>Mildred Pierce</em> is built on three flashbacks. Two long ones explain the course of her life with her family, and a final one dramatizes Mildred’s explanation of what happened during Monte’s murder.</p>
<p>What, then is <strong>a replay, </strong>the third convention I&#8217;m considering? I don’t think critics and filmmakers have a very stringent sense of this device. (See the codicil for further comments.) I’d suggest that basically a replay is a flashback that revisits scenes we’ve already seen. When our heroine recalls her childhood in scenes we didn’t see before, we have a flashback. But if later in the film we see those childhood scenes again, I’d call it a replay. Centrally, a replay revisits scenes we’ve already witnessed, or at least glimpsed.</p>
<p>So not all flashbacks are replays. Are all replays flashbacks? Some would say yes, but I’m more cautious. I’m inclined to say that a mechanical recording of a scene shown earlier could count as a replay without being a flashback. In <em>Rebecca</em> the newly-married couple watches home movies of their honeymoon. This scene fulfills the function of a flashback, but the action we see remains in the present: the couple are screening the film. The footage doesn’t show scenes we’ve already seen, but if it had, I’d call the screening of the movies a replay, but not a flashback—since, again, the action framing it is visible in the present.</p>
<p>This sort of mechanical recording/ replay is very common in modern films, reflecting the ubiquity of surveillance cameras, cellphones, and the like. In an earlier blog entry I talked about<a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2011/10/25/play-it-again-joan/" target="_blank"> a purely auditory replay</a> in <em>Sudden Fear</em> that’s made possible by an audio recording device. It would be odd to call the home movies or the SoundScriber playback flashbacks.</p>
<p>So some replays are flashbacks, and some aren&#8217;t. When they&#8217;re flashbacks, replays are often used subjectively, as when a character remembers an earlier action. Recall all those dream sequences that present, often with distorted imagery or sound, action we’ve seen previously in the film. But a replay may also supply new information about actions we already witnessed and thought we understood. We thought we grasped an earlier scene because nothing signaled to us that pieces of information were missing.</p>
<p>This possibility goes to another creative option. Sometimes the film tells us that something has been omitted. In my <em>Maltese Falcon</em> and <em>Unfaithful</em> examples, the narration is openly suppressive: It announces that it’s not telling us certain things. This of course adds mystery to the plot.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the presentation of the initial scene might be <em>covertly</em> suppressive; it hides things and doesn’t tell us it’s hiding them. In <em>Side Effects</em>, we see the heroine commit murder and then go to bed. Later the murder scene is replayed, but with extra shots showing actions we didn’t see or surmise before. The idea of replaying to fill in previously suppressed information is quite old; you can see it at work in Griffith’s <em>Romance of Happy Valley</em>  and Ford’s <em>Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</em>. In modern cinema, we sometimes revisit an earlier scene several times, with each pass yielding new information (e.g., <em>Go</em>). You might want to call these “multiple-draft replays.”</p>
<div>The <em>Mildred</em> flashback shows that the initial scene was doubly tricky. It <em>conspicuously</em> hides information about the killer, and it <em>inconspicuously</em> hides other information about the circumstances. So the climactic flashback fills in information of both sorts: Who did it, and what really happened in the beach house parlor. The obvious suppression of the killer&#8217;s identity distracts us from the covert suppression of other items.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So now come the real<strong> spoilers</strong>.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gunplay and replay</strong></p>
<p>We start with two establishing views of the beach house, with a car outside. Over the second, gunshots are heard. Shot by an unknown assassin, Monte staggers forward and falls back onto the carpet. A close shot shows him saying, “Mildred” as he dies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_1018.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23626" title="screenshot_10" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_1018.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a>     <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_1119.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23627" title="screenshot_11" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_1119.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>The camera tracks to the bullet-riddled mirror and we hear the sound of a a door. A new shot lingers on Monte&#8217;s corpse. We then see the car drive off.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_1218.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23628" title="screenshot_12" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_1218.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a>     <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_1322.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23629" title="screenshot_13" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_1322.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_1515.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23630" title="screenshot_15" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_1515.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>The next scene shows Mildred pacing nervously on the pier.</p>
<p>I think that this opening lays out two options, one for the trusting viewer and one for a more skeptical one. The trusting viewer assumes that Mildred killed Monte. He seems to glance at her as he speaks her name, and the shot of the car pulling away leads smoothly to the sequence showing Mildred on the pier.</p>
<p>Not so fast, says the skeptical viewer. If Mildred did it, why doesn&#8217;t the film show her doing it, as the <em>Letter</em> scene does? The absence of a reverse shot of the killer resembles the missing reverse shot in the <em>Maltese Falcon</em> scene. So the scene leaves some doubt about whether Mildred is guilty.</p>
<p>The film rushes us along, so we aren’t obliged to decide one way or the other. Eventually we can reconcile the opening with either possibility. If Mildred turns out to be innocent, we can say the film played fair by not showing the killer. If she turns out to be guilty, the missing reverse shot will be seen as simply a device to postpone telling us.</p>
<p>She certainly acts guilty enough in what follows. On the pier, she seems to consider leaping into the surf, only to be put off by a cop on a beat. The lubricious Wally lures her into his tavern, where she stares coldly at him before suggesting they go to the beach house. There, she locks him in, and he discovers Monte’s corpse.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_1715.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23631" title="screenshot_17" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_1715.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>Passing policemen in a patrol car see Wally break out of the house and arrest him on the beach. Mildred’s daughter Veda is briefly introduced at their home, when two policemen come to take Mildred in for questioning. She seems to feign ignorance of Monte’s death, still trying to frame Wally.</p>
<p>At the headquarters, the police inspector announces that they have the killer—not Wally but Mildred’s first husband Bert. Distraught, she claims Bert is innocent and to exonerate him she tells her story, taking us through her two marriages and her successful career.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_1813.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23632" title="screenshot_18" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_1813.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>At the climax of Mildred&#8217;s second flashback, she realizes that Monte’s free-spending ways have enabled Wally to cheat her out of her restaurant chain. She fetches a pistol and drives to the beach house, in a framing that reminds the first-time viewer of the film’s opening shots.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_2020.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23633" title="screenshot_20" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_2020.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>We see her walk through the house, but then the flashback breaks off. We’re taken back to the present, with her talking to the chief detective. “Monte was alone, and I killed him.”  The detective replies that she’s lying; someone else was in the house. Who? Not Bert but Veda, brought in by the cops who have grabbed her when she tried to leave town.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_2111.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23634" title="screenshot_21" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_2111.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>Before Mildred can hush her, Veda snaps out, “You promised not to tell! You promised! You said you’d help me get away!” Veda became increasingly important to the plot as the years went by in Mildred&#8217;s flashbacks, but her almost total absence from the opening minutes blocks our thinking of her as a candidate for the killer&#8217;s role. Soon we&#8217;ll see the pains the narration took to make sure we didn&#8217;t spot her at the crime scene.</p>
<p>Mildred breaks down and launches the final flashback.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_2211.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23635" title="screenshot_22" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_2211.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>She says that she found Veda with Monte, and they admitted to being lovers. Then Veda told her that she and Monte would be married. Mildred reached for the pistol but was halted by Monte and dropped the gun. She left, just before Monte told Veda he had no intention of marrying her. &#8220;You don&#8217;t really think I could be in love with a rotten little tramp like you, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_2313.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23636" title="screenshot_23" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_2313.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>The flashback crosscuts between Mildred in the car and what’s happening inside, bringing us back to the opening situation. Now the skeptical viewer’s hunch is borne out. The replay starts as a faithful version of what we originally saw, providing the reverse shot of Veda that was missing in the opening.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_2513.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23637" title="screenshot_25" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_2513.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>This time we don&#8217;t see Monte hit (that action is covered by the shot of Veda), but he crumples and staggers forward as before. He dies, still murmuring Mildred’s name. Mildred hurries in, finds her daughter standing over Monte&#8217;s body, and succumbs to Veda’s demand that she cover for her.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/4.19-300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23624" title="4.19 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/4.19-300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a>     <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/4.20-300.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23638" title="4.20 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/4.20-300.tif" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The replay explains why Mildred contemplated drowning herself afterward: She was in despair at the couple’s treachery and the crime that Veda committed. When suicide was blocked, Mildred tried to frame Wally for the murder in order to protect Veda. And the replay suggests that it’s not Mildred but Veda who drives off from beach house, leaving Mildred to drift down to the pier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>All together now</strong></p>
<p>At least, that’s what most viewers would remember as happening. My essay argues that it’s just this broad effect that the movie aims for: we recall the gist of the murder situation, and we assume that the only gap in it is the identity of the killer. However, when we look more closely at the two sequences, we see that Curtiz and his colleagues have covertly concealed a lot more.</p>
<p>To get a sense of it, you can run the two sequences separately, then the two of them jigsawed together side by side. In the following clip, the opening is labeled scene A, the flashback replay is scene B. The shots in each passage are numbered. (In <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/books/poetics_04cognition.pdf" target="_blank">the original essay</a>, they&#8217;re laid out in a chart.)</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/68895551" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of sleight-of-hand here. The extreme long shot of the beach house and driveway (A-1) seems to set the stage. The car appears empty. By the time of the gunshots (first heard in A-2), though, based on what we know from the second flashback, Mildred must be in the car already. So you could argue that the dissolve to the long-shot of the car (A-2) conceals Mildred&#8217;s departure from the house and her efforts to start the ignition (B-1). I&#8217;ve wedged that later shot into the synthesized version to show the possibility. Otherwise we must assume that the initial shot of the whole landscape (A-1) follows her going into the car (B-1). Yet in that shot or the one that follows (A-2), we don&#8217;t hear or see the driver trying to turn over the engine. In either possibility, these opening shots display the sort of subterfuges that the film will execute more significantly soon.</p>
<p>The presentation of the action inside the beach house misleads us from the start. After Monte is shot, over the image of the bullet-pocked mirror (A-4), we hear a door, apparently closing. Because we don’t see anyone, and we assume that a murderer flees the scene of the crime, we infer that it’s the sound of someone hurrying out. In the replay, the door&#8217;s sound is linked to Mildred coming in (B-5), not leaving.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_1218.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23628" title="screenshot_12" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_1218.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a>     <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mildred-shadow-300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23722" title="Mildred shadow 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mildred-shadow-300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>A little extra touch: When Mildred is shown entering (B-5) we hear the door make <em>two</em> sounds—opening and closing. Scene A, of course, doesn’t include both, so we quickly take the one door sound we hear as signaling the killer’s departure. (To my ears, Scene A includes the sound of closing; if that&#8217;s right, A&#8217;s narration has simply omitted the sound of the door opening.)</p>
<p>Moreover, the filmmakers have played with the duration of the first scene to an almost criminal extreme. After the shot of the mirror and the sound of “departure,” a straight cut takes us to a peaceful but ominous long shot of Monte’s corpse in the parlor (A-5). But this shot doesn’t reflect what happened right after the murder (B-5 through B-10). When the door opened and shut, Mildred came in and immediately started talking with Veda.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_1323.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23723" title="screenshot_13" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_1323.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a>     <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-at-sofa-300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23724" title="2 at sofa 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-at-sofa-300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>The shot of Monte&#8217;s corpse, if it has any place in the chronology of the scene, belongs later, evidently after Veda and Mildred have left the parlor but before Veda has driven off (A-6). In other words, version A has presented a big ellipsis—unmarked—between the mirror shot (A-4) and the shot of the dead Monte (A-5). All the drama between mother and daughter played out in the B version has been skipped over, without any hint that it was suppressed.</p>
<p>The sequence proceeds by degrees of sneakiness: First, the misleading presentation of the car and the beach house, then the teasing offscreen sound of the door, then the more forcible skipping-over of the conversation. Now consider something even more flagrant. When Monte says, “Mildred,” he says it in two different ways in the two sequences, and thus creates two different effects.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_11-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23639" title="screenshot_11 1" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_11-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a>     <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_27-300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23641" title="screenshot_27 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_27-300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>In the opening scene, an abrupt medium shot (A-4) stresses the line as the dying man’s last word. We know (especially after <em>Citizen Kane</em>) that last words are important, and Zachary Scott dwells on it, lolling his head from side to side glancing leftward, as if he were naming his offscreen killer. But in the replay, when Monte falls (B-4), he simply slumps to one side, head down, and mutters, “Mildred,” <em>before</em> flopping over on his back. Nor does Curtiz provide a closer shot. Now the line is tossed off, as if Monte were simply remembering his wife in his final moments.</p>
<p>In sum, the replay not only fills in missing information; it corrects the inferences we made during the first scene. Of course, the film’s narration had encouraged us—at moments, forced us—to make those inferences, all with the purpose of creating a false impression about who was in the house when Monte died.</p>
<p>You might object that these &#8220;rewritings&#8221; of the opening show less skill than we expect today. Films like <em>Go</em> (1999), <em>One Night at McCool&#8217;s</em> (2001), and <em>Vantage Point</em> (2008), let alone <em>Now You See Me</em> and <em>Side Effects</em>, strive to make the fragmented replays of an event dovetail neatly. But those films have been made in an era when people had the ability, on DVD, to rewatch films closely, and persnickety viewers can check for disparities. 1945 viewers couldn&#8217;t undertake the random-access probes into <em>Mildred</em> that we can. Moreover, as complex flashback storytelling became more widespread in the 1990s and 2000s, I suspect that there was a certain professional pride in making the sequence of events watertight.</p>
<p>More generally, Curtiz and company could be confident that very few members of their audience would recall the fine detail of a scene shown a hundred minutes earlier. I argue in the essay that as the film unrolls, the rapid pace of the action and our inability to stop and go back allows the filmmakers to juggle time, space, and the sequence of actions played out.</p>
<p>The filmmakers count on our inability to recall fine detail. How fine? If the replay had shown Monty falling face down rather than rolling on his back, I suspect that we would have noticed the disparity. But even trained critics, as I show in my essay, at the time and afterward, didn&#8217;t notice the smaller details that deviate from the initial scene, especially the point at which Monte says, &#8220;Mildred.&#8221; Curtiz and his screenwriters have worked comfortably in a zone of fuzzy recall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The differences between the initial scene and the replay can’t be put down to clumsiness or accident. All the disparities in the opening nudge us to draw the wrong conclusions, whether we play the trusting viewer or the skeptical one. The omission of the reverse shot, the most obvious mark that Mildred might be innocent, is a convention, as we&#8217;ve seen; but the other tactics pursued by Curtiz and company are more innovative. The filmmakers have exploited our tendency to jump to conclusions and to ignore details, always in our search for the gist of the story.</p>
<p>In other words, filmic storytelling often takes advantage of mistakes we make in normal thinking. It even encourages us to make them.</p>

<p>The misleading narration of <em>Mildred Pierce</em> has its parallel in crime fiction, particularly the thrillers of the 1940s. See<a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/essays/murder.php" target="_blank"> this entry</a> on the site for more background. A Ruth Rendell novel, <em>Wolf to the Slaughter</em> (1967), contains a boldly misleading opening that is somewhat similar to what happens in our film.</p>
<p>Some details in the presentation suggest that Curtiz has played fair. In A-6, the woman driving off seems to have a light-colored coat, not Mildred&#8217;s heavy fur one. A viewer seeing Mildred on the pier might doubt that she took the car. Still, I don&#8217;t think everything here is perfect. Close examination of a 35mm print seems to reveal a figure in the passenger seat of the car ducking down in A-2. And does Monte, falling to the floor in A-3, move his lips slightly? Did  the scene as shot have him speak the line &#8220;Mildred&#8221; at that point, as he said it in the flashback? If so, did someone decide later on the insert (A-4) that underscores his last word?</p>
<p>For more on the planning of this scene and the overall production of the film, see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mildred-Pierce-Albert-J-Lavalley/dp/0229083706/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371680743&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=mildred+pierce+lavalley" target="_blank">the screenplay <em>Mildred Pierce</em></a>, ed. Albert J. LaValley (University of Wisconsin Press, 1980). You can sample some of LaValley&#8217;s enlightening introduction <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=JhiYejtlK1AC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=screenplay+mildred+pierce+lavalley&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tLLJ1aWX6O&amp;sig=MkT3inSRg1NdyahqaVUlEcDG0Fk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TzDCUYb9CLGp4APjt4GoBw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw" target="_blank">here</a>. The opening scene of the screenplay is quite different from that of the film, but it does retain the false clue of Monte seeming to name Mildred in his death throes.</p>
<p>The narrational maneuvers on display here have counterparts throughout the 1940s, which is one reason I&#8217;m interested in that era. For more examples, see <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/03/28/the-1940s-mon-amour/" target="_blank">this synoptic entry</a>. The critic Parker Tyler has some provocative observations on the film in <em>Magic and Myth of the Movies</em> (Secker &amp; Warburg, orig. 1947), 193-205. His comments suggest how difficult it was for audiences of the time to recall exactly what had been shown: he speaks of &#8220;the sequence of camera shots in which we see the outside of the house, the woman&#8217;s figure (or was it two figures, separately?) leaving it, her ride in the auto, her walk on the bridge, her impulse to leap over&#8230;&#8221; (195). This is a good example of the constructive tendency of memory: We fill in and seem to remember things that didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>A more theoretical point: Some people might say that it’s unhelpful to use the term “replay” to cover both one type of flashback and the mechanical capture of earlier action. Maybe we want to call these mechanical recordings “rerun” or “playback” scenes and reserve the term “replay” just for flashbacks, the dramatized renditions of the scene’s images and/or sounds. Perhaps close look at <em>The Conversation</em> would allow us to sort these concepts more exactly.</p>
<p>In addition, I’ve used the term “replay” to refer to <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2011/05/03/forking-tracks-source-code/" target="_blank">those do-over plots</a> that we find in fantasy and science-fiction films like <em>Groundhog Day, Déjà vu</em>, and <em>Source Code</em>. Yet you could argue that given the parallel-universe premise of these films, each event is shown in its singularity, in a distinct time frame. The scenes we see aren&#8217;t revisitings of a single event, but rather different events. They merely seem like replays because they repeat certain features of events that have occurred in other dimensions. I guess we need some new terms!&#8221;Reset&#8221; or &#8220;reboot&#8221; plots?</p>
<p>Speaking of terms, narrative theorists will recognize in Mildred’s replayed flashback what Gerard Genette calls a <em>paralipsis</em>. Here the narration “sidesteps” an element during the initial presentation and later revisits the situation and fills in the information. See his <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Narrative-Discourse-Method-Gerard-Genette/dp/0801492599/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371680992&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=genette+narrative+discourse" target="_blank">Narrative Discourse</a> </em>(Cornell University Press, 1983), 51-52.</p>
<p>A last musing: Might viewers exposed to publicity come into the film expecting Mildred to be the culprit? (On <em>Mildred</em>&#8216;s marketing, see Mary Beth Haralovich, &#8220;Selling <em>Mildred Pierce</em>: A Case Study in Movie Promotion,&#8221; in Thomas Schatz, <em>Boom and Bust: American Cinema in the 1940s</em> (Scribners, 1997), 196-202.) The French poster below seems to put her in a doorway with a smoking gun. Or is that Veda in the doorway? Perhaps the uncertainty of the narration is prefigured by this advertisement.</p>

<p><em>Edith Head costume sketch for<strong> To Catch a Thief</strong>. From <strong>Edith &amp; Oscar: A Costume Exhibit</strong>, <a href="http://www.wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu/collections/featured/edithhead/exhibit/exhibit.html" target="_blank">WCFTR website</a>. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DB here:</p>
<p>Until the 1970s, academics interested in film seldom paid close attention to Hollywood as an industry. Some economists and historians of law were beguiled by the sight of an oligopoly eventually dismantled by Supreme Court decree. But these scholars weren’t particularly interested in the products of the studio system.</p>
<p>People interested in the movies took three positions. The most dogmatic, voiced by one of my grad-school professors, ran this way: “Money doesn’t matter.” That is, art will always triumph over business. If a movie is good, the circumstances of its making are irrelevant. And we study only good movies, so we needn&#8217;t consider the business.</p>
<p>Another view acknowledged the importance of the industry but saw it as a vague, overarching force. Creative artists were seduced by it or struggled against it. A powerful director like Chaplin or Hitchcock could control his work to a considerable degree. For the less powerful, the studios (along with censorship agencies) were barriers to creative work. They forced directors to bow to the demands of moguls or a debased public.</p>
<p>The third view was largely celebratory. The studios represented a wondrous confluence of talent at every level, from script to music, and the System mysteriously spun out marvels of drama, comedy, and spectacle: Hollywood as Gollywood. Researchers in this tradition ferreted out as much information as they could about the old days, infusing encyclopedic ambitions with fan enthusiasm.</p>
<p>What came to be called “Wisconsin revisionism” or “the Wisconsin Project” proposed some alternatives.</p>

<p>When I came to UW&#8211;Madison to teach in 1973, I was an auteurist with a taste both for Hollywood and foreign cinema. I knew relatively little about how the studio system functioned. Its machinations were simply factored out of my consideration. Directors, from Hitchcock and Hawks to Dreyer and Mizoguchi, were what loomed in my consciousness, and I wanted to spend my life studying what they had accomplished.</p>
<p>But contact with students, faculty, and campus personalities at Madison changed my thinking. There was <em>The Velvet Light Trap</em>, a defiantly unofficial magazine that ran special issues on all manner of non-auteur subjects, especially studios, periods, and genres. There were ambitious film societies like Fertile Valley and the Green Lantern, showing offbeat items. There were smart, well-informed grad students. There was the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research, which housed thousands of prints, the center of my lustful thoughts both day and night. The WCFTR also housed vast archives of papers, scripts, photos, and other documents of Hollywood’s golden era.</p>
<p>Then there were Professor Tino Balio and Dissertator Douglas Gomery. My conversations with them, both in and out of the office, showed me that there were fruitful questions to be asked about the nature and conduct of the studio system. These two scholars, I think, more or less invented the rigorous historical study of Hollywood as a business enterprise.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Gomery-book-300.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-23676 alignright" title="Gomery book 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Gomery-book-300.jpg" alt="" width="314" height="455" /></a>Take Doug’s dissertation (and subsequent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Coming-Sound-Douglas-Gomery/dp/0415969018/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371771763&amp;sr=8-10&amp;keywords=douglas+gomery" target="_blank">book</a>). How did Warner Bros. innovate sound? Was Warners, as most accounts claimed, a threatened company, desperately driven to try a new technology to stave off bankruptcy? Doug answered the question in a revelatory way: The evidence pointed to Warners’ innovation of sound as a carefully calculated business decision made by a company that had already explored the technology and the market. In fact, WB was not going bankrupt, it was actually expanding into other domains, including radio. By using a traditional historical model of technological diffusion, Doug made the Warners’ decision intelligible. He served as a TA in my first course at Wisconsin, and our friendship proved to be a case of the student teaching the teacher.</p>
<p>Tino, who was presiding over the WCFTR, became another premiere scholar of filmmaking as a business. His books, anthologies, and book series brought immense attention to our collection of material on United Artists, Warner Bros., and RKO. He taught courses in the history of the industry, both survey courses and in-depth seminars. I think I learned more sitting on examination committees with him than I had in many of my grad-school lectures.</p>
<p>Many of the research questions asked by Tino, Doug, and their peers didn’t concern the movies themselves. Some did, though. I remember Cathy Root&#8217;s study of stars as strategies of “product differentiation.” More broadly, in the 1970s and early 1980s, some of us suspected that the Hollywood system of production, distribution, and exhibition could affect what then was called “the film text.”</p>
<p>As a result, Kristin, Janet Staiger, and I tried to show how Hollywood’s mode of production did more than simply limit gifted artists or yield pop-culture diversions. In <em>The Classical Hollywood Cinema</em> (1985), <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/essays/classical.php" target="_blank">we tried</a> to understand how the organization of production shaped work routines, technology, adjacent institutions, conceptions of quality, and other factors that did impinge on how the films looked and sounded. Over the years these aspects of filmmaking practice took off on their own, becoming somewhat detached from the industrial conditions that created them. When the studio system faded away in its classic form, the community&#8217;s notions of narrative construction, stylistic expression, professional practices, and other factors hung on. The economics changed, but the aesthetics persisted.</p>
<p>Now there are many people working to show how industrial factors interact with filmmakers’ creative choices. Kristin and I have continued these explorations in books and blog entries, extending them to other periods (e.g., the 1910s, the New Hollywood, the 1940s). I like to think that much of our work over the last decades has tried to blend the careful empirical and explanatory work of Tino, Doug, and others with the analysis of art and craft typical of film criticism. We can ask some questions that cut across the over-simple Art/Industry split.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/WCFTR-500.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23672" title="WCFTR 500" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/WCFTR-500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="49" /></a></p>
<p>This exercise in autobiography was triggered by some recent events. One is <a href="http://www.wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu/collections/index.html" target="_blank">the spiffy new website</a> for the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research. Under its recent director Michele Hilmes and current director Vance Kepley, the Center has gotten a new jolt of energy. It’s promoting its vast collections in an attractive way and is starting to spotlight some that weren’t well-known. The selections are bolstered by informative program notes by Maria Belodubrovskaya, Booth Wilson, and others.</p>
<p>Certainly the Center&#8217;s heart, for historians of Hollywood, is <a href="http://arcat.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search%5FArg=united%20artists&amp;SL=None&amp;Search%5FCode=NAME%5F&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=n6rHUTOfTipYfahdJSeHI0pWzW_Q&amp;BROWSE=1&amp;HC=82&amp;SID=1     " target="_blank">the United Artists collection</a>. This assembles United Artists business records from 1919-1965, scripts and stills from Warner Bros. and RKO, and several thousand film features, shorts, and cartoons, mostly from 1928 to 1948. Then there are the hundreds of <a href="http://wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu/about/WCFTR_collections_list.pdf" target="_blank">named collections</a>, provided by individual donors. The refurbished website calls attention to several of them: the personal and business correspondence of <a href="http://www.wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu/collections/featured/kirkdouglas/" target="_blank">Kirk Douglas</a> (some items now digitized), <a href="http://www.wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu/collections/featured/blacklist/" target="_blank">the Blacklist collection</a> (six of the Hollywood Ten represented), the dazzling array of <a href="http://www.wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu/collections/featured/edithhead/" target="_blank">Edith Head’s costume designs</a> (okay, I’m going a bit Gollywood). There are records for <a href="http://arcat.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search%5FArg=united%20artists&amp;SL=None&amp;Search%5FCode=NAME%5F&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=n6rHUTOfTipYfahdJSeHI0pWzW_Q&amp;BROWSE=1&amp;HC=82&amp;SID=1" target="_blank">Otto Preminger</a>, <a href="http://arcat.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search%5FArg=wanger%2C%20walter&amp;Search%5FCode=NAME%5F&amp;SL=None&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=Z1vRYjDIjPmUIMgz10nRfSmrdrKN&amp;BROWSE=1&amp;HC=1&amp;SID=9  " target="_blank">Walter Wanger</a> (the basis of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Walter-Hollywood-Independent-Matthew-Bernstein/dp/081663548X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371770928&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=walter+wanger" target="_blank">Matthew Bernstein&#8217;s biography</a>), and <a href="http://arcat.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search%5FArg=clarke%2C%20shirley&amp;Search%5FCode=NAME%5F&amp;SL=None&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=fgX3tx1zxoCv2gwpPWRdh69ohZ5X&amp;BROWSE=1&amp;HC=4&amp;SID=8" target="_blank">Shirley Clarke</a>.

<p>Lately, needing information on <em>Guest in the House</em> (1944), I turned to the WCFTR screenplay by Ketti Frings. Her name looks like a Scrabble hand, but she turns out to be <a href="http://arcat.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search%5FArg=frings&amp;SL=None&amp;Search%5FCode=NAME%5F&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=S5t2gcmUpu5mklQg5utMTvbIP2Rp&amp;BROWSE=1&amp;HC=1&amp;SID=1" target="_blank">a fairly significant screenwriter</a>, contributor to <em>The Bells of St. Mary’s</em> (1945), <em>Dark City</em> (1951), and <em>By Love Possessed</em> (1961). Some other day I must get around to prowling in the papers of <a href="http://arcat.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search%5FArg=caspary%2C%20vera&amp;SL=None&amp;Search%5FCode=NAME%5F&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=6Ol5GuL9BAKVtpXoUK2t-AHrdrKN&amp;BROWSE=1&amp;HC=1&amp;SID=3" target="_blank">Vera Caspary</a>, an extraordinary person who is far more than the author of <em>Laura</em> (though I’d be happy just being that).</p>
<p>Beyond Hollywood, the Center holds major collections of <a href="http://www.wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu/collections/featured/rzhevsky/" target="_blank">Russian cinema</a> and, more recently <a href="http://www.wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu/collections/TaiwaneseFilmsList.pdf" target="_blank">Taiwanese</a> cinema. And if you must leave cinema behind for theatre, you can investigate Eugene O&#8217;Neill, George S. Kaufman, and many other luminaries. In sum, a resource to make you happy for decades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A career and a conference</strong></p>
<p>The expansion of the Center owes everything to Tino Balio, who served as director in its crucial years. It was he who acquired the UA treasures and many of the named collections. Access to the UA papers enabled him to write the definitive history of the company, but it also created a huge spillover effect: dozens of research projects were nourished by his pursuit of this collection—which came to us at a time when virtually no universities, not even those in LA, were seeking Hollywood corporate records.</p>
<p>So it’s fitting that, as the WCFTR redesigns its public profile, we see the publication of Tino’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hollywood-Millennium-International-Screen-Industries/dp/184457380X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371783012&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=balio+hollywood+in+the+new+millennium" target="_blank"><em>Hollywood in the New Millennium</em></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hwood-millennium-300.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-23668 alignright" title="Hwood millennium 300" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hwood-millennium-300.jpg" alt="" width="314" height="401" /></a>In a sense it’s a sequel to his earlier books, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Film-Industry-Tino-Balio/dp/0299098745/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371827808&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords=baliyo+american+film+industry" target="_blank"><em>The American Film Industry</em></a> (1976, 1985) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hollywood-Age-Television-Tino-Balio/dp/0044458363/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371827875&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=balio+hollywood+in+the+age+of+television" target="_blank"><em>Hollywood in the Age of Television</em></a> (1990). But these were anthologies, whereas this is through-composed. It’s most like his magisterial survey of the business strategies behind the art-film explosion, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Foreign-Renaissance-American-1946-1973-Wisconsin/dp/0299247945/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371827922&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=balio+foreign+film+renaissance" target="_blank">The Foreign Film Renaissance on American Screens, 1946-1973</a> </em>(2010): a careful study of a remarkable period in US film history.</p>
<p><em>Hollywood in the New Millennium</em> charts the trends that characterize the last fifteen or so years of the American film industry. It surveys financing, production, distribution, exhibition, ancillary markets, and the independent realm. Tino analyzes the ways in which new technologies have changed all these areas, mostly to the benefit of the bottom line, but he also recognizes that technology can undermine the business, especially in the hands of what he calls “the I-want-it-for-free consumer.”</p>
<p>He surveys studio policies, attempts at synergy, and viral marketing. He traces the rise and fall of executives and is especially strong on the emergence of the overriding strategy of the tentpole picture aimed at teenagers and families. Since all studios belonged to entertainment conglomerates, the constant demand was for large-scale profits. For all its financial excesses, the tentpole strategy, Tino argues counterintuively, was an austerity measure.</p>
<p><strong>By the decade&#8217;s end, every studio was in the tentpole business. Although the costs of producing and marketing such pictures were enormous, they were the only types that could perform on a global scale and generate significant returns. . . . The sure thing was a good hedge against a dying DVD business, the fragmentation of the audience, and the unknown impact of the internet and social media on Hollywood marketing practices.</strong></p>
<p>In short, you could not ask for a more concise, reliable map of where Hollywood is today. The bibliography is expansive enough to inspire other researchers to dig into both printed and online sources.</p>
<p>Tino has exercised a remarkable influence on two generations of film scholars, but in an almost surreptitious way. Now every film student learns about the structure and conduct of the film industry, but few know that Tino played a pivotal role in making this sort of knowledge central to academic film study. Now in his mid-seventies, Tino has left a peerless legacy of research.</p>
<p>Speaking of research, our campus will be hosting a major conference that includes the WCFTR as a key component. <a href="http://screenwritingresearch.com/" target="_blank">The Screenwriting Research Network International</a> is holding <a href="http://srnconference2013.commarts.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">its annual gathering here on 20-22 August</a>. I attended the Brussels SRNI conference two years ago and wrote about it <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2011/09/09/jcc/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2011/09/09/jcc/" target="_blank">here</a>. I think it’s fair to say that a hell of a time was had by all. This is a stimulating bunch, and anyone interested in filmmaking would benefit from attending.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SRN-logo.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-23669 alignleft" title="SRN logo" src="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SRN-logo.jpg" alt="" width="264" height="203" /></a><a href="http://srnconference2013.commarts.wisc.edu/program/keynote-bios/" target="_blank">Keynote speakers</a> this year are Larry Gross (<em>48 Hrs, True Crime, We Don’t Live Here Anymore, Veronika Decides to Die</em>), Jon Raymond (<em>Old Joy, Wendy and Lucy, Meeks Cutoff</em> , and several novels), and. . .  Kristin!</p>
<p>The scholars are no less stellar and include Kathryn Millard, Richard Neupert, Jill Nelmes, Steven Maras, Riikka Pelo, Eva Novrup Redvall, Nate Kohn, Ronald Geerts, Andy Horton, Ian Macdonald, and a great many more. Go <a href="http://srnconference2013.commarts.wisc.edu/program/" target="_blank">here</a> for a complete program. You will be impressed.</p>
<p>Needless to say, among the guests are many UW alumni: Patrick Keating, Colin Burnett, Maria Belodubrovskaya (currently a faculty member too), Brad Schauer, Mark Minett, Mary Beth Haralovich, and David Resha. All of them have been steeped in archival research, centrally at WCFTR. Also home-grown are the conference organizers, J. J. Murphy (who blogs <a href="http://www.jjmurphyfilm.com/blog/" target="_blank">here</a>) and Kelley Conway, who is finishing her book on Agnès Varda after immersion in that great lady&#8217;s personal archive. Another faculty member, Eric Hoyt, is curator of the remarkably full and free <a href="http://mediahistoryproject.org/" target="_blank">Media History Digital Library</a>; expect him to divulge newer-than-new research sources and methods. I’ll crowd into the act with a paper tied to my 1940s book.</p>
<p>All in all, I see a pleasing continuity from my salad days, through forty years of teaching and viewing and writing, to this moment: a new Balio book, a sparkling shop window for the Center, and new generations of researchers eager to show that The Industry and The Art of Cinema aren’t always that far apart.</p>
